              "'They look good and stick good! I just don\\'t like the rounded shape because I was always bumping it and Siri kept popping up and it was irritating. I just won\\'t buy a product like this again These stickers work like the review says they do. They stick on great and they stay on the phone. They are super stylish and I can share them with my sister. :) These are awesome and make my phone look so stylish! I have only used one so far and have had it on for almost a year! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT! ONE YEAR!! Great quality! Item arrived in great time and was in perfect condition. However, I ordered these buttons because they were a great deal and included a FREE screen protector. I never received one. Though its not a big deal, it would\\'ve been nice to get it since they claim it comes with one. awesome! stays on, and looks great. can be used on multiple apple products.  especially having nails, it helps to have an elevated key. These make using the home button easy. My daughter and I both like them.  I would purchase them again. Well worth the price. Came just as described.. It doesn\\'t come unstuck and its cute! People ask where I got them from & it\\'s great when driving. it worked for the first week then it only charge my phone to 20%. it is a waste of money. Good case, solid build. Protects phone all around with good access to buttons. Battery charges with full battery lasts me a full day. I usually leave my house around 7am and return at 10pm. I\\'m glad that it lasts from start to end. 5/5 This is a fantastic case. Very stylish and protects my phone. Easy access to all buttons and features, without any loss of phone reception. But most importantly, it double power, just as promised. Great buy this case fits perfectly on the s4 and keeps me powerd all day I can\\'t complain! a+ recommend it to all This is the first battery case I have had for my Galaxy S4. The S4 fits very well, is slim and doesn\\'t add much weight to the Galaxy S4. It doubles the battery life. You can charge either the battery, the phone or both. There is a handy on-off switch with leds to indicate the level of charge.The battery case came on time and was packaged well. Well worth the price. Performs exactly as advertised . It\\'s very  sturdily built,and provides lots of boost . It does exactly what it\\'s supposed too .Easy to insert phone in and out . Definitely a 5 star experience. Don\\'t know what I would do without this case LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases, PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days. It doesn\\'t heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I couldn\\'t wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can\\'t even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won\\'t let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don\\'t know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I\\'ve made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays. THANK YOU POWERBEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just what I needed. I needed a phone case for myself and my two sons, but I also needed new replacement batteries. Now this isn\\'t the case, since I got both in one. Awesome thanks A+ When there is no outlets, or chargers near by its Powerbear to the rescue! Ordered one for my husband, and myself. Great purchase!! It works great. Doesn\\'t heat up like crazy like the other ones I got, and cheaper too! Its definetly the best power case for the S4 you can get, thats why I got one for me and my wife. I wonder why its called power bear.. Surprisingly, this inexpensive version works just as well and just as reliably as the expensive variety. It has been working for me for months now. No problem. Excellent value. I have tested this against the griffin dual output unit.I checked the charging current.This unit was charging my galaxy note battery with 70 ma.Griffin was charging with 40 ma! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for very long. I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up. It worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely.. so basically a small waste of money. I love that it has two ports for my phone and ipod. Who wants to be putting too many things in one socket.  Sleek and convenient to store and I just love it. just what you need, I am always having to charge my phone and then find I have another item to charge also. does not have the need amps to charge things like ipads, or hp touchpads. but its super small and compact. They are nothing special for sure, but it\\'s nice that you can tell when it is powered up by the led that glows in it.  able to charge two phones at once in the car which is nice. I have several chargers. Have more than one vehicle so I keep more than one of these in each. Nothing more frustrating than finding all of a sudden one quits working, and you have no way to recharge your phone. That is always when you need it most.  This one works well for any of my products. I bought this a little skeptical. After I tried it I bought two more. It works great and so far it has lasted for about 3 months. If that changes I will update this review. I am disappointed that the 1A didn\\'t work with my iPad.  That\\'s what I get for buying a cheap adapter. This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China.  When it is charging the phone, the car radio gets LOTS of static.  Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.So, no RF shielding.I gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me, but if you listen to the radio, you might consider it is more like 2 or 3 stars. After a week only one side works Yo get exactly what you order in a timely fashion. And the item is just as described. Great buy if you ask me This is a terribly awesome product in my Subaru\\'s console.  Passengers love it, I love it because it emits a blue glow, because it has held up to abuse over the years and performs like new. I\\'ve bough a munch of different things like this over the years. Most wouldn\\'t stay in the jack, or would give out after a few days. This one is GREAT! Only works one side at a time. When you connect two cables, one side stop working and also overheated burning the fuses. I purchased two of them and it\\'s the same problem. Cheap and bad quality. it works great i like i can charge two thing at the same now i dont have to wait for my to finish charging her phone It came at last, good looking and the price was good and i believe it is worth the time I waited for it to come to me good job Didn\\'t last very long. Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I shouldn\\'t have expected it to last. excellent product, works great , have easy handling, and good quality as it is announced. reached as is shown time and in very good condition thank you very much for everything Purchased two and we put one in each car. Now we charge our ipad and iohone together. Can also use to power my Galaxy Note 2 or recharge other USB devices. If you have to think about it you need counseling great charger for 2 devices and i haven\\'t had any problems so far 3yrs now Purchased product about many a month ago. Pros: Loved it work just fine!! Cool Blue light feature when you plug it into the lighter!! Can plug in two things at one time....Con: Top clear piece came off easily overtime (I just put clear tape around the top) TOTAL: PROS:95% CONS:5% I bought this so that I could use and charge my Tab at the same time. My tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on, it will not charge while powered on. I bought this to charge my iphone and tablet in the car. works for iphone but not the tablet. I needed a stronger charge for that but this is still great for both iphoe and ipod together. it\\'s cheap, small and compact Works great. The blue led light is a nice touch in the car. We charge a Samsung and Iphone using this outlet. Nice low profile too. works great and charges ipads, tablets, smartphones as well as bluetooth speakers and headsets. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a universal car charger. I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I\\'ve had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I\\'m not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I\\'ll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven\\'t found one in my price range yet. This charger works great and is short, unlike most chargers. It does a great job with charging both my phone and my GPS when I am in the car.  Great value and easy on the wallet. I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging, it felt hot. Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt. Tried the other one too and same thing. Be careful... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system This portable USB Port car charger is a must have for people on the go.  Pair this with an extra or spare cord and you are good to go! I love the way it can charge 2 devices at once!  Seems to charge quicker without GPS on, with it on, it only holds the battery, but better than it dying!!! Bought so we could charge to phones at the same time while in the car from the same port.  Works. I received this product before I expected. It looks pretty good and It works with my Iphone (3GS) and my phone (HTC Evo V 3D). It is a good deal because It is not easy to find something like this for this price I have several of these, from various retailers, all the same, each made in some anonymous Chinese factory, all exactly alike.They\\'re great. They really do work, and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do. They do the job.You wouldn\\'t expect much QC for a $2 electrical product, but they each work just fine.They don\\'t last forever-- about a year or two of active daily use seems about par, then they suddenly die. So do have some replacements on hand. At this price, no problem.Yes, they work with both my iPhone and iPad. Also with every other USB device I\\'ve needed to charge.The LED light that indicates you are plugged in correctly is very helpful.These are great for rental cars and travel. If you leave one behind, hey, it\\'s only $2.I\\'m totally pleased with these clever little gems. No complaints. I wouldn\\'t be without a couple, especially for travel.Hope this is helpful. Happy trails, all. good product at low price.purchased this looking for a smaller charger and I love Griffin products.Free shipping just took a little longer I use this in my car to charge my phone and my iPod as needed. It works well, but the bright blue light can be annoying when driving at night. Overall, a very good deal. I love this case! It\\'s so pretty.And I love the way the case feels to the touch because of the rubber. Very happy! The idea of the design is a sweet idea but it wears off as the paint is over the case and not under a sealant or anything. It has a cool 3D effect but at the cost of the paint rubbing off.It is quite pretty though. I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.  But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!  The \"rubberized\" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all\\'d), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking! Another pretty phone case that I really love. I have many as I love t o change them around .thanks The case is not white, its more of a silver. It\\'s still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly. It took too long to arrive. Defintiely worth the price...You should order several.  Most cases are $15 and up especially at the cell phone stores.  I can\\'t believe the mark up on these things! This is a great case... It fit my phone perfectly and I still use it from time to time. Would recommend Received this item very quickly. The design is even more vivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a \"good look\" for their phone. this cover makes an old phone look and feel new. I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone. I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase. The color is more dark in person, and this isnt the best protection case. I get a lot of compliments on the case, and it was easy to put on. Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.My wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone. The case is pretty good. It dose have some scratches on one side of the phone but its every little. Other then that i like it. Ive dropped my phone a few times since putting on the case and it didnt break or scratch. Ive gotten many complements on this case and over all it was worth the few bucks I spent. This case is afordable and yes it peels very easy but thats to be expected because its a dollor. I bought mine from Electromaster. It snaps on fine for me but if I were to drop my phone the phone would be fine but the case would surely be done for. its only a dollar so do not get your hopes up. it looks great but its for show not for protection. if you want your phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box This is one of my favorite cases I have this one on my phone I really love the color a lot. It looked like it was used! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again This case for some reason is peeling, there isn\\'t much left of the orginal skin, i  loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i wouldn\\'t recommend this specific one for anyone. Its rubberized doesn\\'t look like it in the picture but it is It\\'s really cute I love this case used it for awhile but I switch out cases like I do my shoes. Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It\\'s a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it. I haven\\'t tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it won\\'t give me any trouble when I do want to change covers. This case was by far the best case I bought for this phone.  It is very stylish and I received many compliments This is the cutest case EVER!  I love it because it was easy to apply.  I had to switch from the rubber one because after so many uses, it wears out like the bottom hem of a sweater that has been stretched.  This case keeps my phone intact and protected at the same time...WOO HOO!! my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didnt see it anymore on the phone. Use your judgement on that one. very good charger, it woks fine, no complaints!!! I would recommend it!! It was good, but not using it anymore! This product arrived when promised and in the condition promised. It is a genuine Blackberry charger. It was brand new and worked perfectly. For the price, I don\\'t think you can ask for much more than that! Great product. Use this with my Galaxy S4. At this price I bought 2 more. One for work and one to keep in the car incase I ever travel and forget my charger. Honestly I have always loved this specific model, since you can just take it with you on the road not worrying if you end up losing it or leaving it where ever you go. Though it doesn\\'t exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient. I\\'ve had this charger well over a year now, and it still works perfectly.  Most chargers would have broken by now.  The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries. so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it. it doesn\\' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger. Great ! So far.I had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower. When this charger goes it tends to loose it\\'s fit firmly in usb and has a short. Another very good phone charger that does the job and has a  very affordable price that anyone can afford  to buy it. Works well. We use this for travel and it lives in our luggage most of the year. For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great. Charges our Galaxy S3 and Note 2. I needed a charger quick and I didn\\'t want to spend $20.00 at the convenience store for a short, crappy charger. For this price, the charger is great.Pros: The cord length is perfect if you have a tall bed. I don\\'t have to struggle to see my phone when I\\'m laying down.Cons: The plug in is a little blocky but nothing to worry about. The connecter doesn\\'t like to stay in place 100% of the time. It does NOT fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge. My phone is also old and the port is a little worn. That could be my issue.If you need a good charger for a cheap price. Buy this! Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed. Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3. The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3.  They really need to start making these chargers better....I\\'ve been thru several!!!! This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn\\'t expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I\\'ve had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it\\'s still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!! I purchase this for a backup at work.  It charges my SGS4.  I would recommend this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4. This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4.  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product! This is another great product and i will always order from here in the future. money spent well!! If you need a great car charger this is the one you need!! goes into the lighter port a little rough but it charges the phone fine. I wish it had a little more reach so i could use the phone from the passenger seat of the car more comfortably but its not a big problem. it will reach pretty far because of the coiled section but this will put stress on the charge port of your phone which many people dont realize will eventually break it. I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend. They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I\\'m happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you\\'d normally receive in a new/refurb phone). Can\\'t go wrong with the price and certainly can\\'t argue with the benefits of OEM vs. generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!). I bought this for my Samsung Charge. It works perfectly and is built as solidly as the $20 Verizon charger. I highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price! It does what it needs to do, very pleased. I bought some other cheap lame one and will never go back. Charger works great. Haven\\'t had any issues with it at all. I wish it has a retractable cord like some other chargers I\\'ve used, but other than that, I love it. It works great  thus  far no issues.  The only thing i might have limited was a usb Connect or it charges my t989 without fail The big store that is in every town now (can\\'t say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk. Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot. luving it  right now will last about 4 mo so you cant beat the price for it I got 4 of them JUNK!!!......This product must be miss labeled.  I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.  The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens.  I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.  If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.  It charges fast and is dependable. A very good car charger for your phones, charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable, I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger. The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period.  I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it, I\\'ve noticed that it doesn\\'t come apart like most vehicle chargers. WHAT A GREAT PRICE!RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, PLUG N UPLOAD SUM JUICE ...DON\\'T KNOW IF DROPPING IT REPEATEDLY ON THE FLOORBOARD,OR OCCASIONALLY STUFFING IT IN CONSOLE TO HIDE CAUSED FAILURE ...BUT SOON THE GREEN LIGHT FAILED TO LIGHT, AND PHONES DISPLAY SHOWEDIT WASN\\'T CHARGING. SO EITHER SPEND SEVERAL MORE DOLLARS FOR ONE WITHA HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER. Sprint wanted $30 fro the same item.  This is OEM and not third party after market. Bought two.  Work great Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days. Hasn\\'t worked since. My phone does not even recognize it\\'s plugged in. This charger works great. I love the fact that the LED on it does not light up until it is plugged into the phone. Great bargain. Though I`m not a expert in cell phone chargers. This thing works good, but its not all fireworks and hotel parties. Its a charger and it works so I guess buy it. I used this charger for a couple of months now. Its a very good charger. It charges my phone very quickly. It is Samsung brand..works with my Android phones..Galaxy Nexus 4 and Galaxy S2 and S3...recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone I needed a car charger and this was very affordable and it worksgreat! The same thing from the store was three times the price. good oem car charger, i originally bought it for my galaxy S2 and later on that week I upgrated to the Galaxy S3 and it works prefectly fine, I would recommend this product You have to hold it in a certain place in other for it to charge. I\\'ll just buy the Verizon  charger instead This charger works perfectly.  It is the official Samsung charger so I was sure it would work just fine. I highly recommend it. I use this charger with my GS2 from Straight Talk.  This charger is working as expected, charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product, not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past. This thing worked well when it actually functioned, but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.I\\'m guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working, who knows.. What a waste of money. Hope to use it soon.  My other one worked sometimes.  This one does not have the light on unless you are charging. es un cable para carro de excelente calidad , original de samsung , lo tengo algun tiempo sin ningun problema I went thru 3 car charges which they all either stopped working after a few uses or never worked to begin with.This car harder not only works it also charges my phone lightening fast!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!If u are debating u can rest assured this thing is awesome. First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that\\'s forgiveable.  The springs on the side don\\'t have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It\\'s held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month. I\\'ve been using this for about 4 months now and it works just as it is intended.  I would buy again.  Quality product.The cord could stand to be a little longer, but it is of a decent length. Works great nice long cord. Does the trick. Bought several of these to put in diff. rooms & one for work. Good charger and is perfect because it is also has a USB connection. Also love that it is original material it works like that too giving a quick charge when i need it. I have had 3 phone chargers go bad in two weeks. I can not say where I purchased them. Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made. This one is OK I guess. Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord. The cord itself is ok ;however, the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such, is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in, it worked fine. So if you need a cord its ok; however, it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless. For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not. I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful, however, I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item. I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time. It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord........The charger itself working fine up to this point..........Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $19.00 fast delivery, works well. Not very long. I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet. It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone. This detachable sansung galaxy s2 travel charger is simply good. It works perfectly.  The cherry on the cake is because it is longer than the factory original l received with the phone. Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days. I\\'m not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon. When it did work it worked very well. First off, the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine.People in other reviews were complaining that the cord was too short-- about 2 or 3 feet-- and that was what I was expecting. Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller\\'s lack of description and/or consistency. Also I\\'m fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There\\'s no way to verify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it\\'s an original Samsung.  Cord length and adapter style may vary as it seems like the seller is not consistent. it\\'s a charger for dirt cheap and the shipping wasn\\'t more than the item. I wish they had the batteries i needed as well for my phone. but great all an all although i do not use the charger, the cable is useful.  it is longer than what is given with the phone.  the additional length allows the phone to be placed in plain sight, instead of down by the wall receptical This charger doesn\\'t charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100) properly.When I connect it to my S2, the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual (abnormal) way. This charger is exactly like the original one that came with my phone.  It is most definitely a good buy for the price! works good with our phones, better actually than the charger that came with one of the phones initially , great price Was here right on time.Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was the,Whole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient ..... The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well....I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems....I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct!Ugh! I haven\\'t had any problems with it.  It just like the oringal charger that comes with the Galaxy S 2. I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house, the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger. Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger. I am having the same issue with the charger that I ordered for my galaxy note 2. It\\'s a very thin cord, and also very short. Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into... thank you. it did not disappoint. was as expected and does the job though I am going to a new phone as the galaxy 2 has been acting up consistently. shutting down by surprise etc... I love it.  It charges my phone quickly and the cord is super long.  I leave it at home but will purchase another to leave at work. In a nutshell, this is NOT an OEM charger.  Although it has the Samsung markings, it doesn\\'t seat well with a Samsung phone.  This means that it\\'s either meant for another market or it\\'s counterfeit.  With that said, I wouldn\\'t buy this again.~~~~~~~~~~August 17, 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers.  After using this for a while, it is still garbage.  It does not charge my phone and in fact, it drains the phone.  This must be a counterfeit product.  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it wasn\\'t even worth it . I am pleased with this purchase.  The detachable cable option gives very good flexibility for use with other USB cable chargers.  Good quality for a travel charger. charges me up all the way. doubles my battery liek promised. case protects well and the color is awesome nice The color is amazing all of my friends are jealous and ask me where did I get it. They are even more jealous when I tell them how much I paid for it! Great case, powers me up and VERY stylish. Matches my 5C PERFECTLY :) much slimmer than I thought and it ads 125% battery. I am charged for the full day with this case. Great quality product , I love this case it is the perfect sidekick to an always dyeing phone . Now my phone is charged anywhere anytime thanks to powerbear . Really like the name of the case as well !! 5 stars deff ! This case helps me run my day smoothly without having to worry about my phone dying. Plus the color is very beautiful. Bought one for me and another for the wife. Acts as phone protector and charging case in one. Hold charge all day so no complaints. This PowerBear case is a lifesaver!! Charges fast, always reliable. I also love the glossy texture of the case. Highly recommend!! This is a very well built and designed case,with a very cool and attractive color. Phone dies too quickly without it I was surprised it game in three steps, but when i put the case together and slid my phone in, i loved it. It is hard to get off I was looking for something different to my wife and this case its strong and beautiful. Good price and i recommend it. Love it this case is just what I expected and I love the design, it is slim and protects my case more than I thought it would. this is really cute phone case, i like it alot, and it came in when it stated it would too Really cute but the heart doesn\\'t really show up if you have the white iPhone 4. 3 piece case & fits like a glove, looks really cute. Shipping took about 2-3 weeks but really enjoy the case. Do recommend. This one came in broken  The bottom pice snaps on to the sides and the main backing is a inlay piece. Came in scuffed with paint and the pieces will not click in together. If it was not broken I would like it. Also if it wasn\\'t in three click in pieces Great case for my phone. Protects and keeps me charged. easy access to the button and sounds good too. i like it Other power cases muffled the speaker sound. This one had a great sound port on the back for clear listening. Wow!  What a cute battery case! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone!  That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white, (since my phone is white), and my sister\\'s is black,(since her phone is blue).Anyway, these little guys give you power for your phone! If we run out juice, especially when on the go, we can just connect this case to our phone, and it is POWER ON THE GO!! (I\\'m just concerned about the functionality). Great case. Doubled my battery life like promised. Can\\'t beat the price. I would recommend it for a friend. A+ Great case, sturdy, doubles battery, wont have to worry any more. I purchased this for my kid and he is very HAPPY. Bought one for me and the wife (diff color;phone, not  wife, lol.). Firefighter work 24 hr shift and never know when if will get to recharge so this is perfect for me and anyone else that can\\'t always plug in to charge each day. I used to be obsessed with changing phone cases, but now I am obsessed with THIS phone case!! What a great find !! 5 STARS couldnt watch movies on the htc without the battery dying. the phone is great for entertainment. but battery could be better. the powerbear cases is a great fit and a good kick stand on teh back for entertainment. im sold This product is great. I like the kickstand on the back. The power indicator is very convenient to know charge pack status. Not Many HTC one battery cases for sale and this one is pretty good for the price. I would give it 4.5 stars and 5 if the price was $5 cheaper. I never do this, but I almost bought this product based off of the amazing sounding fake reviews provided by the shills for PowerBear. If you look at all the positive reviews for this case, you will see that none of them are verified purchases and yet every negative review, other than this one of course, is a verified purchase. What that means is that everyone who has actually bought and used this product thinks that it is crap. Furthermore, many of the reviewers have posted twice on this product, once per color. Why Amazon allows this is beyond me, but that is not the point. Also, if you look at the profiles of the positive reviewers, you will see that they have posted multiple positive reviews for PowerBear products and many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other. Beware the paid shills! This is absolutely amazing, more than doubles my battery life, so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time.For such a good price, this is just the right deal. A++++++++ Bought case for me and wife to qualify for free shipping. Came in different colors to match phone.  Can go entire 24 hours without charging; but I am not a kid playing games all day long. No complaints or problems. (Personally I wrote another review in the wrong spot since we had diff phones and diff colors I f&%$ up) Since I am always on my phone, the battery life is very short. After purchasing this battery case I am no longer worried about running out of battery life. Watch-out, all these positive reviews are fake. Some have even reviewed it twice using the same name. What a sleazy way to sell an item. My brother just got the HTC One, and I promised him an awesome case like the one I have for my S4.Super sleek look, fits well, doesn\\'t get overheated and saves the day every now and then! Especially when GPS is needed! The color pops out so well. Clips well to my phone and charges me up. I cant complain! No cons! The raised edges protect the screens from falls. The battery case looks stylish and charges me up. This case is fannnnntastic fits well on the phone and it is easy to use. the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised The S5 is a fantastic phone. However because of its large screen the phone dies quickly. With the extended battery I am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power. Great buy. Totally worth the money, It protects my phone in even of the most dangerous situations where I dropped my phone and it also keeps my battery going for Days. BRAVO! I got this case for my nephew, and he claims that it was not what he expected. He has a charge case for his last phone, and it covered the whole thing. This is just like a back of the phone replacement, so it doesn\\'t add to much weight This is a really great case, looks and feels amazing, not to mention that the battery lasts for many hours. I think this case is an excellent choice, since it is not so bulky, the color is nice, the texture on the back is good for gripping, and it extends battery life. It\\'s a life saver, and there isn\\'t too much on the market at the time for this phone so I am happy with it. Bought both blue and black for me and my brother right after we got home from the phone store. Would recommend. compre este Case hace varios meses y protege el celular de manera excelente..ni siquiera tube que comprar protector de pantalla y gracias a dios mi cel este nuevo.. I was looking for a case for my new Galaxy S2 (At&t version). The store was selling similar cases for $20 and $35. I just can\\'t justify spending that much on a case. This case is made for the unlocked version of the Galaxy S2. The size is the same. The only difference that I can see is the noise cancelling microphone is blocked. I drilled a little hole in the case and it works just fine i was raving to a friend about how amazon has great phone cases and how cheap they are and bought him this. it didn\\'t even fit his phone right. poorly made. nice case, protective and good looking, it also has a nice changing texture in some areas. good buy for the price Bought this for my new AT&T; Galaxy SII, the case arrived super fast, its fits the phone perfectly and snug. I have no issues with any buttons, and the rubber is in a smooth, sort of laminated finish. It does not stick to your pockets. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, especially for so cheap.And just FYI: This is for the AT&T; (i777), or International (i9100) Galaxy SII.This WILL NOT FIT Sprint, T-Mobile or the AT&T; Galaxy SII Skyrocket phones. You\\'ve been warned. I liked the case, and for the amount of money paid, its a good buy, i personally like stronger cases, this is very flexible and indeed looks like a hard case, a little bit of more firmness wouldnt hurt.Protects VERY well the phone as well as the camera lens there is not one single part of the phone touching the surface of the table when i leave it there. Very Good purchase. I bought this for the at&t samsung galaxy s2 and the seller was very slow in getting this item to me. I also notice that this product do fit the SGS2, but the cut outs was NOT good. The cut out opening was too small for the power button, there was also an extra cut out for no reason. It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars, but bad opening for my phone will be costly. Like most of the other reviews say, this rubbery case has a smooth exterior, so it doesn\\'t feel like an uncomfortable sticky rubber.  While still appearing to have a hard shell, the rubber itself is fairly soft, and does a great job of protecting from falls without feeling too bulky. the case did not fit my phone; was a tad too small.  i could only get 3 corners into the case.  i wound up buying a two piece case that cost about $20 from a local store.  have dropped the phone so many times the case is beat to s***, and no damage to the phone.  good reason to buy a case, just not this one.my co-worker delayed in getting a case because he could not find one he liked, and broke the display screen, making his phone unusable.  buy a case, not this rubber thing.  i threw mine away within 5 minutes of it\\'s arrival This skin fits perfect in my SGSII and the phone looks great inside of it.It is a high quality skin and gives a very good feeling in your hands.I recommend this product for your SGSII. I prefer this style case to the otterbox and case mate as I feel it provides ample protection without turning the phone into a brick. Lightweight and sleek. I like the case so far fits ok my Samsung Galaxy S2 I like that is very shiny and soft to the touch. My only concern is one of the corners is not totally covered so it wont protect it from scratches or a hit there that is why I am just giving it 4 stars. Well for the price i think it is ok. Don\\'t expect more but it works well for the reason you buy.I was looking for a cheap skin case and was not willing to pay a hefty amount for the case at least for the initial period after buying my unlocked galaxy s II.Din\\'t Expect much before buying.But it really does work well.4 $ with 2 day shipping free is really a good deal if you are looking for a perfect tpu case protecting your phone. Great case fit my samsung galaxy s2 great will order again fast shipping it make my phone look super sexy trust me you need to order 1. I read the first few reviews and didn\\'t read any further and now I wish I had cause this thing does not work for the Sprint Galaxy s2. Wish I had known that. Be careful when ordering these cases. Not all Galaxy II\\'s are the same. Mine was a Sprint and this one did not fit my pnone. It went into the trash can as it wasnt worth sending back. Otherwise I am sure it\\'s a great case. arrive on time, good quality, functionally, recomend to protect the samsung galaxy S 2 I9100, fit exactly , recomend to the owners of this smartphone . I was expecting a bit higher quality product but it is what it is. I\\'ve used it for a few months and it definitely helped when I dropped my phone. But at this point, I am not using it anymore due to the quality of the product, although \\'good\\', it could be better and more solid. there is a different between the size/design of Galaxy II that is carried by USA and what\\'s carried by Asia.  I\\'m in USA, I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA, the cover didn\\'t fit, and the speaker location is different from the phone.  I copmared the cover to another Galaxy II that is sold in Asia and i found that the design is different.So if you bought Galaxy II from USA, don\\'t buy cover from outside USA It is good, and look so cute. I like it. It is cheap than when i saw in a store. I made a good choice whenI thought of buying this, its very safe, & not to bulky! Overall very satisfied customer. Very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is good and the shipping is quick. The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm. Overall I feel my phone secured in the case. totally awesome, It was made with good quality and I would purchase this again in another color it still looks new! this case is better than i thought i love the feel and design and it is well made and doen not collect dust. This product arrived quickly. It fits my HTC and is easy to get on and off, I have no complaints. Great Grip, Great Style, Gerat Durability, Great PRICE! Lasts long. SLIM FIT! Should be included in every HTC sensation purchase and if it was it may have beaten the iPhone 5! Too bad HTC A note of caution from someone who owned and used just about every major Blackberry model: if you already own a standard USB 2.0 cable and you don\\'t need an extra, then you do NOT need this cable. All a Blackberry needs for data transfer is a STANDARD USB 2.0 cable with a Micro-USB connector at one end.There is NOTHING special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated MSRP listed for it. While this item is sold at a 90% off the MSRP discount, it\\'s probably okay to purchase one, for as long as, after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a USB 2.0 cable.The items has 2 stars taken away for the exaggerated marketing claim (professional grade custom cable) and for the inflated MSRP.NOTE: Please make sure that you buy cable with a MICRO-USB connector because this is what your Blackberry needs. this is a good product is just a usb cable it work perfect just like a oem cable. . . Well, went on the internet first....$14.00, then to a very well known store, here in Gloucester, MA, $28.  I was not happy.  Then, of course, I knew Amazon would come up with something...they did, $4.00 and change...it arrived promptly.  I cannot say enough about Amazon, they are realistic in their prices, knowing that people do not have that kind of money to pay for a wire,,for 14 or 28 dollars. I have never been so happy to get what I need without spending my last dollar for it.  Thank you again and again. I would like a extra cable for my smartphones at work, so I purchased this one. Nothing special as long as it is working, and it is.No complain. There is a difference in USB cables.  On some computers, including mine, the USB ports are underpowered, and some poor cables do not transmit data well.  I have purchased some cheaper cables that would not transmit data between my computer and my Blackberry Storm 9530.  This cable works great, even with my underpowered USB ports. I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is. I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode. So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else...spend the extra buck on a higher end cable. I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews.  I don\\'t know how people are getting these cables to work... but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about \"Unknown Device\" and \"Could not install drivers\" even though it works beautifully with the original cable.  The only setting that works is \"Just Charge\"!  Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw!  I\\'ve tried this with my Wife\\'s Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well.  Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device! this phone cord is so easy to use and easily connected from phone to computer. great value for the price. This cable is better than original.  Never any issues with phone recognizing USB connection, as the original does, when plugged to PC. I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2.99 shipped to my door.  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging.  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge.  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two! A good inexpensive cable that works like the original.  I purchased this cable because I wanted one that would work with the touch stone I just purchased.  After reading several reviews and looking at competing cables I deciding on this one.  While several inches shorter (40\") than the original it works well and with the touch stone.  I used this cable mainly for use in the car. The cable worked great with the pre if you need an extra one, but I suggest purchasing the whole unit--plug and all, not just the cable, because with shipping and handling it gets to be the same price. not much to say about a wall charger except it charges my bluetooth perfectly.  I\\'m glad I bought it.  Thank you! This charger does the trick.  The charger in my car doesn\\'t work when the ignition is off, and who wants a dangling cord hanging down in their field of vision while driving.Have charged the T505 up once since I got it, and the battery life is reported to be around 18 hours of usage or 30 days of standby.  I may charge it every couple of weeks.  Very convenient accessory. The Motorola T505 doesn\\'t come with an AC charger, only a DC charger. This makes a great addition to the package. You can charge in your home at night. I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers.  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised.  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc., and at less than 25% of the cost.  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems. we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger.  we now have 2 t505 with the 2nd one intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo.  this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling.  by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge.  great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time. It\\'s true! This cable outperforms the original! When I charge my phone, it\\'s chargier. The data is more datery and the phone is more phoney in general. If I wear the cable around my neck like a bolo tie, people like me better and I can run faster and jump higher.  If I circle my dinner plate with it, the food tastes better. Basically this cable makes everything better than the original. I\\'m thinking about getting a 2nd one! This is clearly not a HTC cable as it has the Blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says Blackberry...but it\\'s a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into.While I haven\\'t tested it\\'s speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that\\'s all I asked for of it.The cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so.It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product, that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product, this cable is 1m long. \"This cable not recommended for this device.\" That is what I get for an error message. Plus it is really short. I only trust HTC accessories for HTC phones having bad luck with aftermarket products that are cheaper, but cheap is expensive. I\\'ll never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working...for the EXACT same phone! I just don\\'t get it. I decided to try it out despite the people that said it didn\\'t work, and I\\'m glad I did. It\\'s exactly what I expected and wanted. I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work. For only $4 and some change for the both...this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery! I was really impressed by the price and was very excited when it arrived. But it doesn\\'t work like it says it does. At first it charged my phone just fine but then it stopped charging; I waited a day to charge again but it still didn\\'t charge. well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last.  so this cord works on when plugged into the wall.  when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything.  so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but don\\'t even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc. I use this cord to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great. Doesn\\'t charge super fast but charges it none the less. this product is great value for the price. and it works like it suppose to. you can\\'t beat it. you always need extra cords. poor manufacturing quality the connector is too long and does not properly fit in my phone. I would not buy this. cable works fine with my verizon Galaxy S4, it charges and transmit the data fine.However, connector tip(phone side) is too thick, it won\\'t fit if you use aftermarket cases. It is what it is. A charging and sync cord. It charges the phone and helps transfer data from the phone to the computer. The cable is good, but it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy S4. It does plug in, but not far enough in to hold securely. It works and is a good value for the price compared to the retail stores. The only negative is that it is just a tad too short. works great. it is always good to have backup cables and this one works great and replaced my old one. I have purchased many chargers for my Samsung phone on amazon and honestly the quality is just so so on them.  Maybe I\\'m just really hard on chargers but I feel like they should last more than a few months.  Spend the money and get a good quality one. I got this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 but it ALWAYS came unplugged from the phone, whenever the phone would be moved it falls out and even just resting on a flat surface it would eventually find its way out of the phone. I had to buy another USB cord because I became very frustrated with this Purchased this USB cable to connect my Samsung smartphone to my laptop computer.  Works well and fits my needs and expectations. it works great and came at the right time you can never have enough chargers for every where lol thanks These were really inexpensive and they work just like I wanted them to.There have been no problems so far It was what I expected to be and works fine, thought it might have been a larger gauge of wire? do you need to charge your phone? so you need to transfer data? then boy oh boy this cable does that. Works fine IF you don\\'t move the phone.  If you handle the phone, the plug works its way out within two or three minutes.  This despite a relatively stiff fit.  Note that the cord that came with the phone plugs in smoothly and securely.  That\\'s my general-use cord now; this one is relegated to overnight charging where the phone isn\\'t being used. Disappointed at how cheap they are and doubt they were designed for newer devices.  They are also very short.  Took a long time to ship.  Specifically purchased due to the ad saying they were for Samsung Galaxy devices.  It did not work in my S4.  They require a good charger a d one that is newer and better. damaged charger. when i recieved it the charger had a short in it. i had to wiggle the cord for my phone to charge. It Works perfect. It charges my phone pretty quickly and it\\'s great that it retracts. No problems with this charger. This is an excellent divice, I have order several within 6 months for family and friends who wanted to take mine. Love it! This charger doesn\\'t work very well. When plugged in, it shows that it is charging, but after ten minutes I\\'m lucky to get 1% more on my battery. I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower...that\\'s really all it\\'s good for. I was pretty upset to find that one day it stopped charging my phone, right in the middle of a long trip. FFFFFFUUUUUUU... I really like this charger and not having the cord hanging around all the time when it\\'s not necessary.  Item was received quickly and was as seller stated. The cord retracts in a snap when I\\'m done with it. It also pulls out to whatever length so that I can just pull it out a short way to plug my phone in and the cord is not everywhere. I recommend it! It works, that\\'s about all that can be said for it. It charges my Galaxy fine, but cord does not retract. Mine came with a busted spring. Cheap enough I don\\'t care, not worth the shipping to return. It charges, I suppose that\\'s all that matters Looking at the price, I ordered 2 of these.It served the purpose initially. But in few months one of them stopped working.that\\'s 50% hit rate. Though, I don\\'t what\\'s the life for the other charger. Initially it is a great charger at a great price. However, I\\'ve been through 2 now and they tend to not last very long. For the price though I guess it\\'s still not a bad deal. love it for moving from car to car.  great for a mobile person. can pack in brief case or backpack when travel, without worry about cord hanging or wrapping. The charger works fine.  It was a great value considering how much they cost in stores.  However, it doesn\\'t retract at all. The plug fits and it charges my Captivate, it felt rather snug. The \"retractable\"-ness of this charger is anything but. Plain ol\\' doesn\\'t work. I literally took it out of the package, and the first time I pulled the cord out - didn\\'t yank, tug, or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it. I pulled it out further, retracted about 4 or so inches of it. Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get. The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length. The main reason I wanted this was for the \"retractability\" since I hate having cables dangling around.Working on getting a refund for this item now. I\\'ve used this for almost 2 years now and it JUST NOW broke. But I can still used it. The button that retracts it just got loose so it doesn\\'t latch anymore. took longer than expected to be delivered but over all satisfied with the charger. the retractable cord is just long enough to reach the cup holder in my truck where i usually put my phone. down side, ive already got 2 welps on my arm from retracting the cord! be careful! haha. was somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews. Price was great so I bought extras just in case. Quality seems great. Cord not quite as flimsy as expected from other comments. Love not having the cords getting tangled in car I love the retractable feature as it hides away so nicely. I does the job just as well as a thick corded device. excellent product. This works just fine to recharge my Captivate. With some products, it\\'s impossible to get a good tight connection to the phone at the USB end; this one does not have that problem. Item shipped and arrived very fast. Item is perfect for my car & phone, very compact. Item is as advertise. Great I gave it to my GF and she loves it. Not much to say, here.  This little charger works well and it was a lot less expensive than Sprint store. I like how long the cord is with this changer so that I\\'m able to reach the night stand and table from where I plug it in at.  However, I\\'m not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge, nor how it atomically &#34;stops&#34; charging at certain times on it\\'s own. This is a very good charger to keep for travel and as a back up in your house. I use it frequently. I was very pleased with this item when I got it back so quickly because it was a gift. However, I cannot give a 5 star rating for a product that never worked. The Phone charger works, it charges the phone. However, while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I\\'ll have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better. I had to replace the cord from the first one I purchased a month ago, but this one is great. It works great. It has a longer cord than the one I got with the phone. I would recommend this item. When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half. Lesson learned,cheap things break too quickly. This power cord is a great replacement for the standard dual use cord that comes with your phone. By dual use, I mean, the standard cord that comes with your phone is a usb data cable with a dc power plug on the end. Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply, which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery. Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable...like this one, which is just fine...quality-wise and price-wise. Yep. Oh, and this does have a big red light that comes on once you plug it into the wall, whether your phone is plugged to it or not, so if you are one of those nit picky sleepers that needs a completely dark room to sleep, you stick yourself a small piece of black electrical tape over the light, because it is brighter then you may think. we\\'ve had it a month and it\\'s working great. wish the cord was a little longer but it\\'s much longer than the one you get with the phone. it works and it works well. i go through chargers pretty quickly so im hoping this one will hold up. so far, so good! the wire is thick and its well put together! as far as im concerned, its well worth the small amount Thanks for the quick delivery time. And, it actually is a quality note pad! Mom loves it, it was a replacement gift for another brand from another company that did not work, this one is awesome! I love that this has a longer cord!  It fits great in my phone!  Very pleased you have it so cheap!  Thanks! Paid $0.32 for the charger and $2.81 Shipping & Handling.....Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work.....which is an all day job huh?  LOL!  Wow, I wish I could write reviews for a living wouldn\\'t that be nice?  I think the total price of $$3.13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $10-$20.  Ms_Thrifty has done it again!  Stay tune to more reviews, Oh how I love Amazon! Gave this 4 of 5 stars because the cord is waaaaaaay too short. Works well. Charges phone quickly also. Wouldn\\'t buy again however. Its a charger and it works as advertised. It also cam in the mail pretty quickly so I am satasfied with that as well. U can never have too many.  Bought this as a spare for purse, home and work.  Now I don\\'t have to worry about forgetting it. Product came really fast, nice long cord, which was great considering factory cord is so short. Worked great til the third day, then I don\\'t know what happened...at the price I didn\\'t expect perfection, and at Sellers defense,I have not contacted them..it could easily be my own fault and I\\'ve been so busy...even review is late. (Sorry) Have this in my office at work for a little extra boost when needed. Nothing fancy just a charger that does what its ment to do. Bought as gift for my relative and he loves it.....Great job...Would highly recommend this product to all customers.Thank you Where you mainly use your blue tooth is when you need to be hands on the wheel...driving.If your BT is down on battery charge, this is handy.  I just wish the length of the cord were longer....I already had a plug-in in the charger nearest me....! I have used this car charger for the last 2 months. So far all is well. Nice retractable cord. It retracts at the push of a button. it was the wrong one.The male end does not fit the Iphone 4s .  Once it was pulled out it would not retract I have not used this as of yet , however, my wife has without issue.I have the x50 headset and she has the voyage, it works on both really well. THIS IS A BAD CHARGER IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND IT HAS A REALLY BAD SHORTAGE. I HATE IT! works great for powering my Plantronics BT. i like the retractable cord so it doesnt have a long cord getting in the way. nice and compact and easy to store when not in use good I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset. I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset. It is clean. No scratches. No faded labeling. It looked to be brand new. Oh yeah...it works great, too.&#128077; I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this.  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth.  Overall good purchase for the money. I\\'ve been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out.  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I don\\'t have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through. Love this type of headset.  I use one at work every day, so I got one for home too.  I hate things &#34;in&#34; my ear, so this quality over-the-head type keeps everything where it belongs and I can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation.  Comfortable and lightweight.  Doesn\\'t even mess up hair.  It includes a leatherette &#34;cup&#34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don\\'t even use it, finding it comfortable even without it.  It converts to an &#34;ear hook&#34; type also, but I don\\'t find that very useful.  The inline volume control and mute is nice, although a bit large and heavy.  Great sound quality This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price. Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy, I\\'m guess that was an issue with the 2.5 to 3.5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone. Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor. I bought this for its durability, but the sound quality was pretty low/poor; volume was low too. This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i.e. very good). The 2.5mm jack means it won\\'t fit on some mobile phones (this is smaller than a standard headphone jack), but for my Blackberry it\\'s great (both 8820 and Pearl). As a bonus, I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers (both with the attached messenger keyboard and without) for online gaming. Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn\\'t seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It\\'s held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around. It\\'s not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn\\'t take batteries, doesn\\'t have to be recharged and isn\\'t subject to interference. I\\'ll buy it again if/when this one finally dies. I love the product even though I messed up and didn\\'t know I needed a 3.5 so had to purchase adaptor.  I had a small issue that was my own fault and this company was outstanding with customer service. Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound.  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality. These have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties. The volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time. I\\'ve been buying these headsets for several years, recommending them to friends and associates and now I\\'m buying them as gifts for the headset challenged. You know, people who literally have pains in their neck from clamping a phone between their head and shoulders.These are wonderful headsets. I\\'ve used them with a variety of cordless and cell phones. As long as you have a 2.5mm socket, you\\'re in business. Audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss. And the microphones are simply top-notch.I\\'ve had only one break and that was because I crammed it into a travel case - and I mean crammed. With regard to ordinary daily abuse, these hold up well.All in all, an excellent value.Jerry I\\'ve tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150. This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone. I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends. It\\'s nothing fancy, no volume control and no mute, but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone. Price does not determine sound quality. I recommend this product. A nice change for me - having a headset that doesn\\'t slip and slide, fall out of my ear, or buzz. My favorite feature is the button that controls the sound level the recipient of my call experiences. The only time is doesn\\'t work well is when the listener is also wearing a headset, and even then, I suspect that it is the fault of the listener\\'s headset and not mine. The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you.  This is pretty important to me, so I only give it 2 stars.  I have used it extensively with both my cell phone and my cordless phones at home with the same problem. I don\\'t think this will last very long.  I was thinking of deploying this in a call center environment, but I don\\'t think it would last very long.  Plus, the cord is too short for desktop use. Before buying this set I searched a lot and did read a lot of reviews and finally I chose to go with this set. The screwdrivers are very easy to use specially with iphones.I had to change the batterry on my iphone and if Stanley screwdriver set was not there I was about to break my iphone.Thanks for making this set so helpful and easy to use. Handy little set to have around if you tinker with electronic devices. This set has many uses for otherthings also. Product is as described and price is right. I recommend everyone having a set. I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws. The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job, so mission accomplished. The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft, meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you\\'re screwing. (Sorry, there\\'s no other way to say that.) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances. I think this set will come in very handy. Screwdrivers work well, however plastic separator tool tip broke off on the first phone case I used it to open...what a drag. I like them but they are not super duty materials. Works great for the application but when I was dismantling a hard drive one of them stripped.  Im not too concerned because of the price. Over all good value! The one plastic wedge broke on first use.  Otherwise, it is about what I expected.  A usable set of tools for phones and some laptops. The Torx screw drivers work wonderfully and the tweezers work well, but the pry tool is too weak and ineffectual for the project I used them on.I bought this kit to remove the cameras out of my HTC 4G LTE and I didn\\'t have any problems except for removing the small plastic portion on the bottom rear side of the phone.  The pry tool was way too flimsy for the job and I\\'m not convinced that it would do the trick for any similar function.I\\'d recommend this kit if you primarily purchased it for the Torx drivers but not if you require the use of the pry tool as well. This comes with 4 flats and 2 philips. I believe they are also metric in sizes. I used one to take a part a netbook. I like the fact that they spin, come in a plastic kit. They are reasonably priced. These items are high quality. Handles are small and can be hard to loosen a screw if torqued down. I used them for a laptop not as a jeweler so... Nice case, nice color, small area, ... Comes in a card board cover as well. Packaged and more packaged. A little over doing it there. Can\\'t be at times a little difficult to open the plastic case. Was going push up or down. Comes with different sizes. Some of the flats seemed a little thick in the blade. Not a bad item for the price. Always good to have a set of these around for glasses/sunglasses or for other items with small screws. I had to replace the battery on my phone cause it had gone completely flat. Apple was charging a lot and this battery did the job perfectly for a lot cheaper and came with the tools. Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much. The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked, once it\\'s in the phone it is not an issue. So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced. So far I would recommend this battery.Update: 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything. Drained it and charged from dead several times, made sure that location services, blue tooth, apps closed... all OFF and still drained. Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery.... A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries. plastic pry tool kinda sucks, but all the other tools in the kit are quite handy, helped me fix a broken screen on a $500 phone so saved a bit of cheddar there. The tools helped greatly. I used the tools it provided and followed the instruction video on Youtube. Everything was done in about 30mins, for a beginner like me. The battery, which replaced my 2-year old original one, works well so far after about one and half months. It gets charged very quickly and lasted very long. For average user like me, the battery last for about 10 + hours every full charge. Wish it was magnetized but it\\'s sturdy & has the common pieces I need when I\\'m working on smaller items or electronics. Seems sturdy though only time will tell. bought tool kit to do a battery upgrade on my cell phone. since it has an embedded battery I needed to take the phone apart. like the saying goes when you got the right tools things go a lot easier most of the time. Used this in a phone I repaired, battery fit perfectly and seemed to work fine, phone was on 5 percent, left it for two days, then I checked and it was on 1%, seems legit. I haven\\'t used them all yet, but they aren\\'t as quality as some of my precision tools.  Like the pry tool and tweezers. I must agree with Gary Tuscon\\'s review. For under $5, even though the smallest flat-head screwdriver in here is 1.4 mm (too large for the screws that hold the links on a Seiko women\\'s watchband), the quality is such that I will keep them. The case is very good and labeled very clearly. The screwdrivers have a decent weight as well and the handles turn smoothy.If these came in smaller sizes, with tempered tips that smaller sized tools need to be strong, I would definitely consider them as well.If I had one minor nitpick, it would be that a color-coding of the handles would be a great help, but really, this is an excellent value for the price. These tools gets the job done. Had no problem I was able to finish less than a hour going to also buy two more for my friends. great deal and quality product quick and fast Thanks!! Very pleased with this tool kit.  I have already gotten a couple phones repaired with this kit with no loss anywhere in the kit.  Would purchase again if necessary. This set has some very unique screw driver  heads, the kind of set you need for working on cell phones or household small appliances. You would have a hard time finding some of them. the torx is the only real useful tool in here for the evo4g. not a big fan, just use a credit card instead Seem to be high quality compare with the cost. Have every thing I needed (or more) to open my Motorola Droid. I should\\'ve ordered at least two sets.  These come in handy for a lot of things, home, workplace, etc.  And as soon as others know you have them, they need to &#34;borrow&#34;.  Keep you eye on them!  Great tool for a lot of little projects.  Fair price. These tools are better than expected. The handles are hard plastic but fit my hand nicely and the the rotating tops work well. The tweezer ends match perfectly so they pick up small parts with ease. Similarly, the driver tips are well machined and accurately sized. Only the plastic prying tool seems a bit flimsy, but it nevertheless held up to some hard prying without breaking. In all, a good deal and I\\'m ordering a second set this evening. Needed for my Razr cellphone to change the internal battery.  More tiny screwdrivers than I\\'ll ever use but are of good quality for what I needed. Seeing is how the 2, 5 star reviews on this item are from fake users who seem to be trash talking other iphone battery sellers and 5 staring there own is pretty messed up so therefore it appears this seller is some type of scammer. After viewing some youtube videos on this procedure, I was able to swap the battery in about 1/2 hour (which included taking pictures and studying the insides of the iPhone 4S.The tools are good enough to get the job done -- I never felt that the tools were going to fall apart.  In fact, I\\'m keeping them around for other mobile phone work.The only thing I\\'d recommend (esp. for older folks with not-so-good eyesight) is a good way to magnify things so you can see what you\\'re doing.  I use a big magnifying glass, 1.5x reading glasses (3x would be better), a headlamp (to add light where I need it). Pros- Good tool set if you need to take things apart.Cons- They came in a plastic bag (no case)- They\\'re extremely flimsy plastic that makes me feel like if I use them over 10 times, they\\'re going to break.I don\\'t recommend this at all and would recommend you buy something other than this. Judging from what I\\'ve seen in other reviews and what I received there is inconsistency in what is being shipped out.  I received a zip-lock bag containing 12 pieces. (See user uploaded photo that matches the description below)- 6 Torx type drivers, magnetic tip (T4,T5,T6,T7,T8,T10) (Orange handle, with blue cap)- 1 Philips driver, magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 Flat driver, magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 3-point driver, magnetic tip (clear red handle)- 2 tweezers (stainless steel, on blister packs)- 1 pry tool (dark green)I purchased this set to do some work on a Droid X (MB810), and they did the job well enough, except I had to carefully use the T4 instead of a T3 *very* carefully on 12 screws holding the screen assembly together. I\\'ll give it a 3 star rating \"It\\'s OK\" Battery would not charge in iPhone. iPhone shut down after 2 minutes of being powered up. Had to throw it away. i bought these tool to us for repairing my nephews iphone 4 but non of them were the right size, so if you buying them for the iPhone don\\'t buy these Does not fit the 4s so make sure you are ordering the right one.  You will need tools, so I suggest you get one with tools. I had to pop open my Samsung Galaxy S3 to fix it up but none of the tools I had worked or fit. These worked perfectly and fit the screws and took it apart with ease. Compact and easy to carry around.It arrived on time and in good shape. Thanks! worked great I use these for electronics repairs.  There are several sizes and configurations to meet various needs.  The most helpful thing about them is the independently turning barrel which allows you to apply pressure on the end of the tool and easily turn the barrel/screw right or left.  They may not be the best tools on the market, but they have served me well. These are all torx drivers, there is no flathead or phillips in this set, which is going back to Amazon today. Nothing too special over here.  Just some screwdrivers.  Seem to hold up well.  I used them on my g-shock band, and they worked and didn\\'t strip, so I was pleased. I got this to try and replace a screen, found out I\\'m not a phone repair person.  It did have what I needed, lacking skill needed to do the job.  I can replace my hard drive in my home computer, and add memory, this takes allot more skill.  If you have the skill, the tools are great and very complete.  I had everything the video said I needed, minus the skill. very helpful and good quality I rate this 5 stars. Love this product! great price and quality. Love how it works with my iphone 4. And it comes with a lot of tools which is great, in case you misplace one of them. It has a lot of what I need to do basic repairs on a phone but it is bare bones. Could have been better for the price and wait time. 2 of the drivers are labeled as a 1.5 but are clearly different sizes. Also the wear kinda fast if working with tight screws Very fast delivery.  product is as described and useful tool.  If  you need a set of these this is a good one I use these mostly for electronics repair and they get they job done. Great for phone repair or and small electronics. I watched a short video on you tube then ordered this kit.  I changed the battery in just a few minutes.  Amazingly simple.  All the tools you need are here (the star screw driver is the only thing thats not really standard, but here its all in one place).  Just do it. You may not need these types of screwdrivers often, but when you do need them, nothing else will do.  They\\'re great for tightening eyeglass screws or opening up the cases of small electronic devices.This is a nice set.  It comes with 4 slotted and 2 philips style in a variety of sizes. They seem to be well made and I suspect that they last a long time. The swivel heads allow you to put downward pressure on the screwdriver as you turn it to minimize the risk of stripping the head on delicate small screws. The case has a labeled space for each screwdriver. It\\'s your typical plastic case with a snap top and should hold up as long as you don\\'t step on it or drop something on it.  This set is a nice value for the price. It is chinesse(like almost everything in this world LOL) but they are really well done, and for the price they are a bargain.The screw drivers have a free rolling top to make pressure, and the body is rellay good, nice grip and 3 lobules ergonomics.The pliers are just as good as you can get, no problems with them and good finish on the edges, not like razors like othersthe prying tool is just what you need for almost any device you want to tear apart(besides the iPad) they have enough strenght to pry out plastics and even aluminun bodys of smartphones.There is to mini screwdriver, a flat an a phillips, I use them for electronics.Overall pretty satisfied, I would buy another one later on Really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made of cheap plastic adhesive removing tool again cheap plastic you get what you pay for would not recommend to anyone who is trying to perform phone surgery Not the best ive purchased but it came with the right size for iphone 4 but the ones with the yellow handles are really just different sizes for a star screw, and none of them fits the iphone 4 star screw. You can always use it for another gadget though. Once or twice a month you need a smaller screwdriver than your always handy six -in-one. This setfills the bill nicely. When you need it you need it. A must have. this item came in a timely matter and fit the descrition the only thing that the plastic broke a little to easily but other than that every thing else is good Nothing fancy but is extremely useful when you need it! love the tweezers and the big writing telling me which tool is which size. Took a while, 3-4 weeks i\\'d guess, but was worth the wait! I\\'d easily recommend them. I received it today and it doesn\\'t charge. I\\'m sure it is used - I found a piece of broken iPhone glass on the contact side. Like others have said here, the screwdriver set is solid and good quality and will last forever.  The issue of course here is that the screwdrivers are not a true jewelers set and will be too big for most jewelry/watch related tasks.  So if you are looking for that type of set, this isnt the one to use. It\\'s $6 so I don\\'t know if I\\'m asking too much. The screw drivers work and are slightly magnetized. The prying tool is completely junk and broke before I had even finished my task - a guitar pick is much more durable. The tweezers are also worthless. Get them for the screwdrivers, not for the other tools. I needed a new screwdriver set to work on laptops with, as most of my old ones have mysteriously disappeared. At the price, there was no way I was going to beat a set of Stanleys. The best part so far, to me, is that they come already magnetized. I put them to use the day I received them, and am quite happy with them. I purchased this battery to replace a water soaked one in an iPhone 4. I don\\'t even know if it is charging or not as the unit won\\'t turn on for me. The shipping is prompt, the packaging great, and the description is accurate. now I have it. I can carry it with me and always have the perfect size tool for the little things that go wrong. i have used this kit to fix a bunch of cell phones  and price is right and tools work great I\\'m sure that there is something that says it will not come as pictured, but still I was disappointed.The tools helped me get the job done, but they also did not hold up well. The plastic plying tools bent and broke fairly quickly. I can\\'t say that it wasn\\'t user error, but they seemed very cheap. I bought this for my wife\\'s 2 year old iphone 4S.  She said it seemed to work about the same or a little better than the old battery.  Not a huge improvement, but an acceptable replacement  if you need a new battery. This review is for the iPhone 5 battery and tool set. I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing, so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate.Like many other &#34;power users&#34; (i.e. slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5\\'s internal battery. After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you\\'re taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn\\'t been sitting on the shelf losing it\\'s potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery. Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive. That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement. After two months of use, I can make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger. My life is complete again! This is a good buy if it is what you are wanting.  I misread the product info and did not realize this is all Torx screwdrivers. This was a great deal.  Easy to install and a direct fit replacement for the iPhone 4s.  Does what it should and hopefully it will last. I fix my own phones and Tab 3 and Mac computers (desk top and laptop), and IPad(s). So having the right tools are very important to me. The price was the thing that did it for me. Great price!! Purchased this to remove screws on my Samsung Galaxy SII but even the smallest tool in the set was too large. I bought this set and have repaired my android a few times already and it\\'s a must have tool set when working on such small electronics Great tools, I still use them and I like the quality, great price as well.Good vendor.I would buy more. This tool set is better than expected. The machining and finish is very good. If used for small electronics and similar applications, this set should be durable. not bad,but Too little things inside is incomplete, and the bad use of hexagonal. But it is ok . thanks This was a great deal for the set. High quality materials at a low price. I would recommend this product to a friend. Tools were required for opening GPS, iPOD, etc cases. Nice selection of sizes. The plastic wedge tool is easily damaged. A five star rating if it included a case (I would have even paid extra for a case) the Torx screwdrivers were great, the tweesers were substandard, and the spluger was very cheap, mine broke the first time i used it.  For the price you cannot expect high quality.  all in all it did the job These were a supper price and while not supper strong they will do the job and you get a lot for your money. For the price, you cannot beat this little Stanley screwdriver set.  This one features several very tiny standard and Phillips head screwdrivers.  If you have a need for very small head screwdrivers, this one is for you.  These are useful for messing with eyeglasses, certain electronics gadgets, and firearms.  I have several revolvers and pistols which have sight adjustments that have outrageously small adjustment screws.  For these sights this little kit is a must -- none of my other tools could manage to fit these screws but this one did.  That alone made it worth the Amazon price and this little kit has a permanent place in my range shooting bag.  RJB. This tool repair kit is useful for repairs on a laptop, smartphone, eyeglasses, and anything else with very small screws. Had a mix up with getting the item and slow shipping but it was all resolved in the end so I am satisfied with the purchase I really needed the torx driver tools to fix broken Nexus 4 back plate and this kit worked great. I\\'m really glad to have it around in case I need it again. i ordered this to replace my iphone battery, i am a deployed soldier and now i have become the cell phone technition The battery worked very well! I used the screwdriver and the plastic pieces of the kit in replacement, and the tips of the spudger get bent without hard use - such as prying the old battery out. Still, a great value in a DIY kit to give new life to your tired iPhone 4S! I tried two (yes, two) batteries and had to send both back because both were crap. I finally decided to spend a bit more hoping it would equate to more quality. Well that seems to have paid off (third time\\'s the charm I guess). The battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly. It holds a charge well and reads the correct battery percentage. The included tools were a bonus. I already had a set of tools from replacing my wife\\'s battery a while back. However these were much better. The old tools I had were stripping the tiny screw heads. This set of tools gripped the screw heads perfectly. Overall I\\'m very happy. very handy tools i mostly use it when i have to fix soomething small like phones docks and other cool stuff very nice quality set of screwdrivers. they sell bigger sets on here for cheaper, but made by a different company. DO NOT BUY THEM. if you want a quality precision set of drivers. this is the company to go with. the tools are ok Just not quite what I  expected.  They were, however, better than the ones that came with the screen I ordered. Got this to replace an iphone5 battery that was only useable when it was tethered. Now it holds full charge and is ready to go. Great OEM repalcement. The tools are nice enough to use again too. You get what you pay for. They strip easily. VERY cheaply made. But I only needed them for a one time use and I didn\\'t have to spend a bunch of money so I can\\'t really complain. But if you will need them more than once...spend the money on good tools. I have never bought an actual set in a box before.  Over the years I have just cobbled together an odd assortment of small screwdrivers.  This was well rated, inexpensive, and in a case.  It is all that I expected.  It works for me. Good but if you plan to repair or take apart apple products this kit is completely useless and won\\'t be worth it Was about ready to send my Jawbone Era back. Then I ordered the Jabra ear gels. Now I can wear my Jawbone all day! Aliph should include these with the Jawbone headsets. And I intend to tell them! Jawbone Era is awesome too! I bought these eargels for my bluetooth, which happens to be a Samsung WEP200, and it fit it perfectly. Gives great comfort and a perfect fit. Comes with more than just three. Comes with a whole bunch. Highly recommended product I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset.  The Era comes with 9 different options for ear inserts.  But I always felt like the earpiece was about to fall out, unless I jammed it into my ear so far that it became uncomfortable.Enter the Jabra EarGels...  These made a huge difference.  It fit perfectly onto my ear (the nub on the top goes into the spot above the ear hole).  I could wear this all day.  I wouldn\\'t wear these eargels without having an over-the-ear hook attachment on my Era, but these have made a huge difference for the comfort of my bluetooth earpiece. The eargels fit to the earpiece is fine, nice and tight, but as far as actually getting ANY of the sizes to comfortably fit, FORGET IT I got these for my jawbone headset. Many had said they work great. but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone. On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset. Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off. That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound. However, I returned them because of the poor fit. They would probably work well on some other headsets. If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try. When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic.  They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it.  Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset.  The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear.  I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so.  I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all. these were advertised to fit the habra stone.  they did not. i don\\'t know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit.  threw them away I bought these to redirect sound into the ear for my jawbone. TO that end it worked like a champ. the only issue I have is that after about a year they started to yellow. I guess that is common with these clear jelly products though. The Jabra Eargels are wonderful.. I cannot believe how comfortable, and user friendly they are.  Thank you, if not for these, I could not use my bluetooth.Great Merchandise.. I purchased these because the original ear pieces from jabra were OK but left me pushing on my headset constantly trying to get it in my ear more.  Which, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of accidental button pushing and disconnecting calls.I saw these on Amazon and thought they were worth trying.  I loved that you get basically 6 ear gels in 3 sizes for both right and left error.I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise.The ear gels are gentle and fit in the ear.  Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset.  Also, while I enjoyed the product I feel it may be slightly over priced for what you get.But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I don\\'t have to keep pushing my headset in to hear.  I would recommend this product to others who find the jabra sound decent but also wish it would go in the ear a little more. people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential..A must have for any headset that will fit them These Ear Gels Work Very Well, Comfort Is The Main Reason I Bought Them, Fit The Ear Very Well, The Price Was Right, You Will Not Go Wrong With These Ear Gels, That Is Why I Gave Them Five Stars Works great on ear buds. I bought these to put on my basic ear buds and have them fit more comfortable so I can wear them longer. Great for wearing in the car during long drives. I bought these so my headset would be more comfortable...These hurt your ears just like the one that comes with it no matter what size you use. I wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone...Don\\'t waste your money. Purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset. It was just not comfortable, but with these all is great now. Could not ask for a better set of earpieces. Great use of my money to get these. These are the exact ones that I was looking for but there is one problem.  They are supposed to be clear but they arrived yellowed in the package.  It is obvious that they are new, but they have yellowed and are no longer clear.  I bought these to replace existing ones that I have that have yellowed but not to the extent of these new ones.  I have had the previous ones since 2010.  I will keep as spares but am unhappy with the condition of these EarGels. I like this Jabra earboom so much that I have purchased 6 of these so far.  And that is my biggest complaint, is their poor quality of workmanship.  They work well but just don\\'t last.  Granted, I\\'m a road warrior and my earbooms probably go through more abuse than a casual user.  The reason I keep buying them is the audio quality is fantastic and the fit within my ear is solid.  I keep two spares on hand at all times so as soon as one fails I can throw it away and move on.  At this price, I can afford it.  Also, Jabra customer services is great.  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge. The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  It\\'s a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I\\'m not happy with these. Jabra makes, by far the best hands-free devices on the market.  This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it\\'s faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it\\'s peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn\\'t have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don\\'t like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don\\'t like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra\\'s newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money. these are the very best quality at a AWESOME price.Save $20. over a cell phone company price. These things were terrible.  The &#34;Boom&#34; would keep pulling the ear but out of my ear and I couldn\\'t keep anything in place. The cord was very flimsy... It was just an all around bad buy.  Wouldn\\'t do it again. Yeah, I know, they warned me; but I thought I was smarter than the average bear- not so.If you have auto reverse on your tape player and you cannot shut the feature off, this will not work.  It may work for a few minutes at a time, but will always end up frustrating you by switching every few minutes.If you can turn off the auto reverse (or don\\'t have it), it\\'s a very solid product that sounded great.For those like me who need a FM transmitter instead of the tape version, I\\'d suggest the Soundkase FM Transmitter for iPod & MP3s.  We\\'ve been using it for a week or 2 with good results (and from my research, probably the best results you can get if you can\\'t use a tape connection). Good Item, BUT.....The sound could be better...U get what u Pay For!!$8.00 for this as opposed to minimum $130 for a CHEAP CD installed in the dash.Well worth the couple of $$$ Not really worth getting.Except for very limited application this is not an good way to connect a audio device to the car stereo.this item creates a bunch of mechanical noise and in addition the sound quality from the attached device is very poor. It works but is not worth listening to unless one has to.  As limited as the fm transmitters are they have significantly better sound quality.  I\\'d return this except it would cost more to ship than it is worth. My moms car couldn\\'t have an upgraded radio (freaking saabs...) but one of the two positions didn\\'t work. Still worked for her though. Great for the price.  Sound quality is not what it should be, I think, but my kids love it.  I like the idea and am going to buy one for my car, but a different brand to see if there is a difference in sound. I was worried about having problems with the Auto Reverse, but it worked the very first time in my \\'05 Audi A4 with factory stereo. The sound quality isn\\'t CD level, but then again its better than my old FM transmitter. I tried using it with my Sansa Clip MP3 player in my Toyota MR2. The car makes a lot of noise in any case, so I\\'m not holding out for audio lab quality. However, the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click. I might have been able to tolerate that. However, there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine. The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player. The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok. I hadn\\'t thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long\\'s to replace the Coby CA-747. The volume with the Maxell product was very weak, and I had to turn it way up. The Maxell didn\\'t go click-click-click, but it whistled, too. So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me. I\\'m trying out the offering from Philips next... Purchased this to try out in the workplace. Don\\'t have access to a decent sound system, so wanted to be able to pipe some mp3s through the clunky boom boxes that are available, without having to lug around a CD case. I was very pleased to find the sound quality is excellent. Playing mp3s from a phone or player sounds more clear and louder than if I were to tune in a radio station. This model had some of the best reviews on the site, and it appears to be a good unit so far. I had to go with 5 stars because you can\\'t beat the price for something that works this well.**Update** It has been about a couple of months so I thought I should add that this unit has worked out great so far. It gets many hours of use and delivers very clean sound. I couldn\\'t be happier with this purchase. I have been using this Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter for more than 2 years to use my car stereo to play audio of my DVD-player and CD-player. Until lately, my car tape player kept rejecting it out. I thought it was broken and I was about to buy this same product from Amaonz again. While reading some other people\\'s reviews, I bump into R. Penny\\'s feedback on 10/26/05 about the \"skip\" mode as following:\"One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a \"skip\" mode. When a tape player\\'s \"skip\" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it \"hears\" sound again. If your tape player has a \"skip\" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in \"normal\" play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to \"fast forward\" over any silent portions of your audio feed.\"This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the \"skip\" mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again. Very good product for the money. I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who\\'s cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door. I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter. I more than got my money\\'s worth out of it. works great in my 2002 honda accord!  other adapters have either gimped the frequency range or only come out of one speaker. Just for kicks I did a \"local order\" at 2am Monday morning because it said the package would still arrive on Monday. I didn\\'t believe it, so I figured, \"I\\'ll pay for that and when it doesn\\'t arrive on time I\\'ll get my money back for the shipping cost\" (I mean come on, it was 300 miles south of me!!).  Only 12 hours later the package had come 300 miles onto my doorstep.  That my friends is dedication to one\\'s time commitment. Wow.As far as the product goes I love it! The plug is the stretchy spiral type so it doesn\\'t hang around getting tangled on my feet while I\\'m driving.  It was way better than that last stupid cheap one I bought at best buy that the cord wore out on after 2 months.  The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly. Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter.In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality (without that white noise the tape players give off), adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75% volume and keep it there while plugged in.  From this point just use your car\\'s volume to amplify the volume.Good luck! This item doestn work on 2001 Chevy suburban.I tried too many things to get it work but no chances anyways dual position thing is good for using with different players. I have a cassette player in my car and wanted to be able to plug my MP3 player into it. This adapter looks like a cassette with a wire coming out of the end. It slides into my car player and when I plug it up to my mp3 player, it plays through the system with no problem. I have not had any trouble from it yet as others have written about. I went on a trip 2 weeks ago and used it for several hours. It worked great.  The wire can be changed to come out of the side or the back, depending on which way your auto player is oriented. I opened it and didn\\'t see where the springs were.. If anybody can take a pic or describe it I will love u so much. Good product but i was getting the reel error on my tape display in my ford expedition. It makes my blackberry phone sounds great. Dislike the radio so please help me. OMG , if u have a tape deck and need AUX use this product , it\\'s not exspensive and sounds great and works with MP3 , CD players , phones . its got awsome sound !!! way better than a FM Transmitter !!!!! I was using an FM modulator, but didn\\'t like that with my iPhone, it would create feedback in the car speakers, so I decided to switch over to a cassette adapter. This one works fantastic for the price. Sound quality is fine, about what you would expect from a cassette tape. The cord can be adjusted to travel from the adapter horizontally or vertically, which is great depending on your tape deck.The only negative I found was that after a few weeks of use, it stopped working properly. My car\\'s tape deck is an auto-reverse deck, and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks, then shut down on me and stopped, but if you look at J Cristofferson\\'s review, there are tons of comments on how to fix this. I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly. Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple. Takes about 5 minutes, and I have no experience with this kind of thing whatsoever, so if I can do it, you can do it! Pros:- Love the adjustable dual position for the cord. Most players you need to insert the cassette sideways, but I had some players before that you need to insert the cassette lengthwise. You will never go wrong with this adapter as you can feed it to your cassette player both ways.- Does not look cheap. It looks more decent than other cassette adapters I have that costs 20$- The coiled cord is great and much less clutter.  I had a cassette adapter that has a cord that was too long, it got caught under the seat and the only way to remove it is to cut it.- Sounds good too with my Ipod.Cons:- The only thing I can think of is it still makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette.Bought this item twice already. We have a 93 Mercedes which has a tape player that is oriented to take the tape width ways. This unit can have the input cable changed to accomodate this type of side loading tape. Sound quality is great. I did not have to modify the unit like some of the other purchasers have mentioned. Sometimes the adjustable input cable connector gets loose and just needs to be plugged in tightly. very disspointed not getting a coby cassette tape because it did not work in my car :/ i need my music Seems great at first. But sound is kind of shaky, almost like the magnetic head is not making good contact. Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it\\'s hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again. It\\'ll get stuck in this infinite loop. You have to take it out, smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in. Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell. pull on your device too quickly and it\\'ll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck. my car had to get used to it as it is old but after a few try\\'s haven\\'t had any issues with it since and it just plays the music on and on now but i will note it doesn\\'t sound beautiful might be my cars speakers though not sure. I would agree with the majority of the reviews. I purchased this for my car. I don\\'t have the MP3 connection but do have a tape deck. And I wasn\\'t thrilled with the quality of sound with the FM tuners (my brother has one for his car). There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing, but with road nose and the general nose of the car, it is a non-issue...can\\'t even hear it. The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection, but I consider it very good...(not sure it\\'s even fair to compare). I use this primarily for audio books, and I am very happy with my purchase. I have not had to try the fix that some of the other reviewers had (something about needing to take out a pin on the inside of the cassette).I would definitely recommend! I fixed the issues, for the time being.  I turned down the bass on my stereo.  I also made the default volume 75% on my phone.  This is the combination that worked for me.  I also left the casette in.  I figured if there was dust and other stuff in there, then i would have to let it settle.  The burn in period was about 3 days.  Afterwards it was AMAZING, the sound clarity improved so much. So don\\'t give up, try these things. You may need to clear the dust from inside your tape player, I\\'m sure that may be the cause of many issues.Fix eject issue:[...] But will keep this short and sweet -Cord contains lead and must be handled regularly in a car where there is nowhere to clean your hands after touching the thing.Sound quality quickly goes downhill with crackling evident after only 5 uses.Now stuck in my dashboard player because the modular adapter broke off and the cassette will not fully eject. I am sure the husband will be griping the entire time he tries to get it unstuck.Avoid at all costs!I scanned past the negative reviews since this product had a few really positive reviews with a lot of helpful votes. Big mistake as now I have to unstick the adapter from my cassette player and try to get Amazon to take it back. (I bought 2 on clearance) My car doesn\\'t have an iPod connector so I bought this product. I have been using this for over a year now and I am very happy with it. This works amazingly well. These things are just a confidence trick. They don\\'t do a thing. They can\\'t do a thing. If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too. Come on Amazon, I can\\'t really believe you are selling this under your own name! This thing is a waste of paper, it doesn\\'t give u any better reception. This is a total rip off in my book :-( I would like to say that this is not cheap junk, but it did nothing at all for my cell reception.On the other hand I have an iPhone with AT&T;, so it could be that combination doesn\\'t work with it.It appears it worked for a few people with a different phone, so I am going to be generous and give it 2 stars, taking into account it could have been my unit.;-) I gave it 3 stars because I was generously sent a bunch of these on only one order.  Otherwise I am not so sure that these work very well.  I have tried on 2 phones and the results have been inconclusive. Want to try one? They sell these at the dollar stores. It does nothing to improve your signal. I set my phone down on my computer desk for 10 minutes and I checked the Signal Strength on my Droid X and it read -87 dBm. After putting the Universal Cell Phone Antenna Booster on the inside of my batter cover I set my phone in the exact same spot for 10 minutes and It read -83 dBm (closer the number to zero the better the reception). So I guess it works a little bit. Check out the picture I posted of the signal strength before and after. DO NOT USE THIS THOUGH IF YOUR PHONE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY CUZ US CELLULAR SAID IT VOIDED MY WARRANTY, BUT US CELLULAR IS THE WORST CELL PHONE CARRIER OUT THERE. I SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN NEEDED THIS WITH A BRAND NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 BUT I DID...THE INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT I\\'ve always had one of these on my phone. Had to get a new phone while on vacation and the service at my rental was terrible!!! Slapped one of these on and, I don\\'t know if it\\'s the power of suggestion, but my new phone works soooo much better!!!! Love these things! Recommend!!! Didn\\'t work, It did not work at all. I have a dead spot when I drive to work, where I totally lose the Signal. This device did not help at all. DO NOT WASTE your money on it. even for less than $2.00, its not worth anything. I bought tis booster for my phone because I needed better recepion, I tryed it and it made my phone come in a little better I would buy is product again, if fact I bought one for the whole family. i cant say it works because i tryit for a long time on my iphone and it didnt made a difference at all... It helped me get improved signal strength for cellular (phone) communications, but does nothing to improve my Android phone\\'s 3G data signal or WiFi data signal. I didn\\'t expect it to and I don\\'t think it\\'s design to improve 3G/Wifi so if that\\'s what you\\'re hoping for, forget it. If you want more bars... this works very well. Order this product just to find out if it does work..and sure enough I was surprise that I get more bars reception  in my cell than I had before and the price is right. I purchased this for my sisters phone. She continually has calls dropped, so I got her this signal booster, and it hasn\\'t made a bit of difference. I bought these before for my previous cell phones, and they really seemed to help. But apparently not so much anymore. Its simply awesome. What else to say? Contrary to what this site and T-Mobile lead me to believe, T-Mobile could not provide coverage at my home address.  This did not stop Amazon.com from selling me the phone, nor T-Mobile from transferring my existing (working) AT&amp;T number to their service (of course, this took two weeks and &gt; 10 phone calls).After receiving no reception, I called T-Mobile and was informed that they do not actually cover my area.I called AT&amp;T back, and they happily attempted to restore my account, only to find that T-Mobile refused to release the numbers.After a month of essentially no coverage from anyone, my phones are happily back on AT&amp;T where they belong.The bad news is that T-Mobile has sent me a bill for more than double the quoted monthly rate and Amazon.com has not refunded my purchase price.Even in areas where I could get coverage, the phone itself did not work well.  After pressing more than a few keys, the screen would lock up and I needed to remove the battery to reset it.Last warning:  Watch out for the charges for inbound messages--if you really dislike a T-Mobile subscriber, send them lots of text messages (free from their site)--the subscriber has to pay $0.05/message. I\\'ve had my T610 for about 3 months now and I\\'m still in love with it.  I highly recommend getting a bluetooth adapter for your computer to take advantage of customizing this baby.  I\\'ve downloaded Midi files, games and photos off the web and copied them to the T610 for FREE!  No SMS charges or web site fees.  It\\'s everything I wanted in a new cell phone.  Camera, color display, fully customizable.  It\\'s great.  Battery life is still good.  Standby about 3 to 4 days, talk about 3 to 5 hours, maybe more.  The down side... Color display hard to see in bright daylight (but not impossible), it has frozen on me a few times, mostly with internet.  Internal antenna may not be as strong as an external,  but I usually get great reception even with only 1 bar showing (inside bldgs).  Highly recommend, might want to look into the T626 or T630 for better color display.  Go get it! Overall, I think that it\\'s a safe investment in a mobile phone. One sad thing about cell phones is that they improve so quickly, there\\'s always a race to have the best.Right now, this phone is one of the best, without the 300+ pricetag. If you\\'re paying 300 for it, you aren\\'t getting a good deal.Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display. Only downside is the wiping it off thing. Oils form your skin and ear show up easily on the pristine surface. Very clear pictures and nice graphics.I give it a 10 out of 10. I\\'ve had mine for almost two months now and I\\'m happy with all aspects of this wonderful powerful phone.  Will definitely buy another S-E phone again in the future.  I still don\\'t like T-Mobile\\'s coverage and especially service support, but this phone is a star.  Some may find teh buttons a bit too small, but they are well-spaced so fine for my large hands.  Voice clarity is superb for me, and the quality/durability is great. Now that I have used the SE T610 phone for almost 2 months with my Palm Zire 72 and HP IPAQ 4155, I must give it 5 stars for the following reasons:1) The Camera is great. The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don\\'t judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one\\'s PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile\\'s unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live. the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20.  Sony took my address and said they would, but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged!  It\\'s been 3-4 years and it still works.  It went through the washing machine and half the dryer.  It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes-  it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc.  I buy  a $25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes.  It\\'s been a great little phone. Great features - except for the phone one.  Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses).  However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one.  If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :) I just called T-Mobile with complaints about my weak battery and told them talk time on the cell phone is 840min according to Amazon\\'s specs for the T610 phone. T-mobile told me the talk time is 5 hours (300min). Who do you believe? I am tired of liars and money-gobbling b*st*rds! I\\'ve had my T610 + Tmobile for about a month now (So no word on the rebates yet) but as for the phone and service... I\\'ve been pretty satisfied.  I get pretty good reception everywhere... The phone is small and comfortable and everything seems to work on it without a hitch.  The camera is good enough for a cell phone... and the phone was more pleasing after I got a few new games/themes/ringtones on it via the infrared port.  The phone doesn\\'t have all that much memory but I deleted all the predefined themes/songs/graphics (or at least all the ones it lets you), and that gave me more than enough.  It hasn\\'t frozen on me yet (and mine came with the oldest firmware).  I heard upgrading the firmware resolves freezing issues, increases the quality/compression of the pictures, and overall makes the phone more useable... but I none of these things have affected me like others, so I haven\\'t looked into how to upgrade it.  Unfortunately, you cant just update the firmware yourself...  Two of my friends also have the same package and are pretty happy with it.  I think most the reviews on here are just people who\\'ve had negative experiences... Considering how old the phones that use this type of battery are, I am not surprised that I received a used battery. I am a little mad at the fact that the product listing said these batteries would be new though. The battery I received holds the charge for about a day, which is the same as my old one.Disappointing indeed. Good product. Quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described. I am Very satisfied with this purchase This is an excellent replacement battery, it fit just fine and the price was amazing. Anyone needing to replace that old battery that won\\'t hold a charge should totally look into getting one of these! The item is working very good. My phone does not have problem with power with this battery and me neither. If I\\'d bought this battery where I bought the cell phone, it would\\'ve cost much, much more.  I didn\\'t need a new phone - just a new battery - so instead of adding another used cell phone to the trash heap, I\\'ve recycled a used battery and kept the phone I really like!  The phone now works like new! I bought this to try and repair a POS dash cam, even though this battery is great it was not the issue... It fit perfectly and accepted charge as it should. Works great. I\\'ve been using this for over a year, seems to hold charge good as OEM (it is OEM) Bought this for my wife to use with her Samsung Exclaim. For those that don\\'t know, the device clips to your earlobe after placing the speaker in your ear. She loves being hands free now. If you want to go hands free without going the bluetooth route, get this headset. It will only work in a phone with a 2.5mm jack. Most smartphones are 3.5mm (like standard headphones). I love the compact design and fit of the ear rest. You can barely tell you are wearing this thing. The mic picks up great! Using this thing all the time now and keeping spares in the car for when bluetooth gets fussy... This serves the purpose if you need your hands free.  You get what you pay for, but I don\\'t need to use it very often, so it is compatible with my phone and is easy to use--not much you can mess up!  If you need one that you will use a lot, you may want to buy something more advanced, but this is a good backup and was very inexpensive. This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased, yet the best small headset ever made. It lasts forever! I only bought it for Xbox live but it works great with cell phones too. It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I\\'m not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great. So if you\\'re looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset. I went ahead and bought another one before they\\'re sold out. Try to buy from OEM planet if they got it in stock, they are the best in my opinion. I don\\'t know, I\\'ve always liked high-tech and loved the idea of bluetooth, even though it tends to make one look like a space alien contacting the mother ship or a blathering fool until someone notices the bluetooth unit in your ear.But I\\'ve never gotten good reception with bluetooth units or enough batter life. Don\\'t get me started on static and wind noise.That\\'s why for the money you can\\'t do better than these wired units. They\\'re lightweight, comfortable, and have ample cord length. I\\'ve ordered several, and you\\'d pay 3 times the price in a bog-box electronics store. Do yourself a favor, even if you do own a bluetooth, keep one of these one hand. Well worth the price. Overall, it\\'s a great headset for the price. Pretty amazing actually. You\\'ll need to get a wired converter to convert the 2.5mm to 3.5mm like this one:Headset Adapter 3.5mm to 2.5mm Audio Adapter and Converter (Black) - Non-Retail Packaging. No biggie.But the curved rubber piece is really stiff and hurts my ear after about 30 minutes or less. Sometimes quite painfully.I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset, so I have two). No one complains they can\\'t hear me or do they need to turn up their volume. Noise cancellation is also pretty good. Not as good as my cheap jawbone, but then people usually complain they can\\'t hear me as well on that one. So, stay away from this if you plan to talk on the phone a while or have larger ears. Small ears may work just fine. Mine are probably about average for males. Otherwise, worth the price. It doesn\\'t fit my phone and now I must return it. What a hassle! That\\'s all I have to say! I ordered this based on the rave reviews I saw for it.  I am using it with a Treo 600 and I can barely hear anything out of the ear piece, even with the spongy covering removed. As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned, the problem is with the connector jack, the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack, which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin. When they are new they work very, very good, excellent sound quality. It\\'s perfect for those of us who don\\'t have smartphones or a headphone jack. Sound quality is excellent and it makes multitasking so much easier. Long wire so that you can put your phone in your pocket no problem. This is actually a lightweight comfortable phone headset.  The problem with it is that when the phone rings and you go to pick it up, it takes a while to attach to your ear.  Also, the speaker part is covered by some foam that picks up ear wax and gets dirty extremely quickly - not an item you would want to share with someone.  Once you get past these two problems, the sound quality is good, and it is easy to wear. This didn\\'t work in my phone. It was rather cheap, I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made! I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work.Unfortunately it didn\\'t work that well. I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo. Worst of all it was supposed to block outside sound, but it didn\\'t do this at all.I know that it was designed for xbox so I am not going to give it 1 star. I don\\'t have a home phone so I haven\\'t tried it for that. Purchased a total of 3 so far.. 1st one had no sound but seller replaced immediately.. others were purchased to use by co-workers instead of the $50.00 apiece ones they were given from verizon purchase.. Stay in ear and work well... Does what it is supposed to and comfortable to wear.  The only downside is there is a slight whooshing sound in the ear piece, may or may not be caused by the phone. This item is useless.  The plug is far too small to fit my phone, despite the description that this will fit \"LG phones\".  I own the DARE and this doesn\\'t fit.  The DARE uses the standard jack while this thing is the 2.5 mm whatever.  Who uses such a tiny plug? I\\'ve NEVER seen that size on any cell phone!  You get what you pay for.  This item is a joke. This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried.  I like the fact that it is small, that it sounds OK, and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it, which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them, they were about $3 apiece with shipping, and the first two are buzzy and could not be used.  I would not recommend this product. I went to an over the head headset by Jensen, and am VERY pleased! It was liked so much that even when it broke the user wanted the same product as a replacement. I ordered 3. I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it.  Well, my husband tried it and decided he needed it since he did a lot of driving for work.  I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back.I love that I can use these with my cordless phones as well as my cell phone.  I prefer the corded sets, they just seem to have a better sound quality.  I love that this earpiece fits snuggly around your lobe.  I wear glasses and this works out great.  I go between this style and one that wraps around my head, it just depends on which handset I pick up.  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset. well, its a easy product, but it is just I hope buy, it arrive on time and the way I waiting but it hurt my ear More importantly, the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap, thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly.  When mine arrived, it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in.  No box, no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band, just chucked it into a bag.  I realize it\\'s super cheap but it should last a month.  Is there we are at now?  I wish Amazon would be... at all selective on what they offer for sale. Not too sure how to make it stay put, but it seems to work well.  I purchased this headset for my mother and she has not complained about it yet! Sound was fine through the headset, however the Mic did not work at all.Waste of money and not worth returning. The earpiece is stamped \"Verizon\" and is of different finish than pictured. There was no packing slip enclosed but the USPS envelope in came in showed, \"ACCSTOP\" in Oxnard, CA. For $2.47, I guess it doesn\\'t matter but still, not the item pictured.  It also came in a little plastic baggie - it was represented as new.Cannot try it as the 3.5mm adapter hasn\\'t arrived from the other item in the earpiece set purchase. I have purchased 4 different Jabra headsets, because they are the most comfortable and easy to hear with, but they have poor microphone quality. I thought I would try this model, the MX150 Flexible Boom. Again, sound quality was crap. I make a living on the phone, so others being able to hear me is very important.I have ended up getting a Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco which has worked the best so far. I\\'ve bought about 20 of these things by now, and shared them with many friends & family, who rave about them.  It\\'s comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you\\'re in the car.I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you.This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it\\'s also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won\\'t give you cancer.  (Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I\\'m a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much. I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a \"universal\" adapter (micro-USB male to 2.5mm female). The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It\\'s not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it\\'s compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it\\'s a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it\\'s perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I\\'ve had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That\\'s not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It\\'s better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping). So, aside from Nokia compatibility, still no complaints. The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded. IF they could make the same product wireless it would be Exceptional. I love it, has great sound, cofortable in my ear and it plays the different ringtones i have for callers so i can know whos callings. Bought this as a gift. Didnt get much feedback from the giftee. But I\\';m sure its working fine. Price was good, not much else to comment on. I have an old style flip phone which uses 2.5mm plugs. This works well by being clipped to my ear and I can use it to chat hands free. No problems connecting to my pre-existing phone at work.  Ear loops not the most comfortable so I have ordered the behind the head neckband (Plantronics 64397-01 Neckband for CS50/M3000) (waiting for delivery).  Highly recommended headset regardless! Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them.  This Plantronics CS50 is simply the best unit I have ever used.  The unit worked my desktop phone answering system in my office.  I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day.I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for. This device solved both problems.  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control.  It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call.  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch.I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease.  The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit.  Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me.  Not with this unit.  The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty.  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy.  This is the first tool I would buy if I were setting up a new office today.  It is great! Very clear transmission of calls both incoming and outgoing.  Easy integration with current phone system. I would buy again if needed. I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this.That being said, this is my first day using it and I have a 12 hour conference call at work, so I may edit my review later. I am impressed so far. The setup was super easy. I plugged it into my VoIP phone and away I went! There was something in the description about &#34;USB,&#34; but this unit is hooks up to the phones headset port via a regular old telephone jacks input. There is not USB on this model. The company does make a USB model, but this is not it. I called Amazon to confirm that before I ordered it and the rep looked it up for me, he was very helpful.I am using the mute feature now, and I like how it beeps every so often to remind me that I am muted. I can go about my business here without the person on the other end hearing everything that I do, but I can still hear what is being said on the other end.Overall I would say if you are on the phone all day, or work from home like I do, get one! I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers.  One tried to get it to work, and finally gave up.  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call.  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time...if there is a next time. Mine died and I needed a new one. Works perfect just like my old one. Good product would recommend to anyone. I\\'ve had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can\\'t remember exactly when I got it).  I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don\\'t place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn\\'t charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I\\'ve looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don\\'t believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you\\'re left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking \"talk me off speaker phone\", and I have to explain to them that I can\\'t.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I\\'ve never had one, so I can\\'t comment on them.  I\\'ve heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can\\'t just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a \"soft phone\" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can\\'t comment.  My experience is stictly in a home office environment. I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say: &#34;This is a great case and held my phone waterproof on a whole cold weekend trip. My whole pack got wet and this case kept my phone dry. I would recommend this to anyone who needs  tough waterproof case.&#34; I got this otterbox to hold my valuables at the pool this summer.  It is the perfect size for what I need and it is completely waterproof and crush proof.  I put some paper inside of it and held it under water and it was dry as a bone.  Then I had my 100 pound son stand on it and then me at nearly 200 pounds and it did not crack. very durable, water tight, use this in my backpack to keep medical supplies dry, the clamps hold tight with a solid click when shut This case works great! My wife and I are taking up kayaking and we needed some way to protect our phones. I have a samsung galaxy s2, she has a blackberry bold 9000. We each put our phones in our cases and immediately plunged them into the water to test to make sure they didn\\'t leak. They worked perfectly! My wife even flipped her kayak and that was the true test, we righted it and checked the phone, dry as can be.I recommend these, i do wish there was some padding these came with as the phones do bang around inside a bit. I\\'ll put my own inside, but for the price I think they could have included something. The product is okay but could be better. The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don\\'t think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine. I am still using it but be aware that if you fly with it you may need a tool to pry it open after landing. I have one of these filled with charging cables (both dock and lightning) for iPhones and iPads, car chargers, wall chargers and everything needed to power our mobile devices while traveling... conveniently placed and easy to grab if we\\'re going anywhere, knowing all the while that we don\\'t have to worry about forgetting anything or cannibalizing our cables from around the house. Keeps everything safe, secure and dry. This phone is amazingly small and light for a camera phone; it even has a flashlight/flash. Problems the phone has that I find to be a real problem: 1. The battery life is the worst of any phone I\\'ve ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don\\'t use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don\\'t have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn\\'t sync with your computer. You can\\'t transfer anything. I don\\'t get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can\\'t back those up.I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn\\'t the best, but it isn\\'t bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can\\'t put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it\\'s a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I\\'ve had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I\\'ve taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn\\'t use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I\\'m use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere. I was with AT&amp;T since they bought out L.A. Cellular. The customer service was great for years, but got so bad I?d wait on hold for hours and couldn?t get through to a person for days. I don\\'t want to rehash all of the stuff that\\'s already been said about this phone. Here\\'s something that nobody told me before I bought it: You cannot use the Infrared port on this phone to transfer data to and from it using a PC. You can use the infrared on the phone as a wireless modem for Internet connectivity (this works for me) but the EasyGPRS software provided to manage phone entries etc. does not work with Infrared. I\\'ve checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this. When I called tech support they suggest that I buy their data cable (read: shell out another $70) for that purpose. It is very misleading to show this phone as being IR equipped while its use is crippled.BTW, I gave this phone 4 stars because it is still a sleek looking great phone. This phone is ugly and heavy and has a terrible user interface even for techies like myself.  It also drops calls like crazy here in Manhattan.  The Moto V600 is a much better phone, takes better pictures, gives you better clarity and reception, is smaller, and is much, much cheaper.  Get the Moto V600 if you want T-Mobile.  Stay away from this ugly monster. ..and I\\'m from Europe, where the phones and networks are much better than in the States. I have to say that I think Samsung currently have the best software (and I used to be a huge Nokia fan). Amazingly light, very intuitive, great audio, and just looks great. I recommend this without any reservations whatsoever. I had the Samsung V205 and then I decided to try the E715 out. FYI to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely. I\\'ve been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn\\'t have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics.. although you won\\'t be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you\\'ll see that person\\'s face.2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205. Furthermore, the games are actually java with E7154) The flash can also serve as a flashlight. Which is quite useful sometimes when you don\\'t know where you\\'re walking and the light is pretty bright.5) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures. Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won\\'t find bluetooth on this.Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won\\'t have to press a button just to see the time... it\\'s always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it\\'s saved, and you look at it, it\\'s in full color so no worries there.Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really. Another great thing is that it doesn\\'t have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it\\'s a good buy. I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone.  A friend recommended Nextel, saying we\\'d use the direct connect function.  Cool.  So I ordered an i730 from Amazon.  After charging and activating and waiting the required day, I called to get my phone number.  It was a Palo Alto, CA, number!?  That\\'s over 700 miles away!  An 11 hour drive to the next state.  No way close to a local number.  Nextel did not seem to understand or care.  &quot;It\\'s the closest we have.&quot;  &quot;There are no 602 area code phone numbers left.&quot;  I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix.  Nothing doing.  After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere, I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone.  I canceled the Nextel service.  They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments &quot;we can\\'t change&quot; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don\\'t you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return.  It was a pretty color screen though . . . And it was pretty much worth it (if you sign the plan and get the phone for $250). Otherwise it is a little pricey. The gain was enough to make me feel good about buying it though, and my plan was up anyway so no remorse there. It\\'s difficult to tell from this picture if your i95 is any bigger - but it is less bulky. The features are the same but a little better. And of course GPS is nize. I\\'ve glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it\\'s a little underrated.  I\\'ve had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn\\'t squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn\\'t wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It\\'s called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it\\'s hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don\\'t listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I\\'ve ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn\\'t exactly a PDA phone, but it\\'s software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.  Great phone, if nextel services your area, you won\\'t be disappointed. Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It\\'s the best Nextel has offered yet, although there\\'s rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there\\'s coverage.  I\\'m a happy customer. I don\\'t own this phone. I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710. I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since \"downgraded\" to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are \"Out of Service.\"Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710\\'s always have better signal compared to the i730\\'s. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone. Lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life. For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use. I have to say that this is a great phone and the Nextel service is great also.As for the review from the moron from Denver You need to have used it and the service before you open your mouth and make a fool of your self.People that review something and not have a clue just goes to show that stupid people should not breed.I have had the I90c,I95cl and the i730 and the 730 is great as for a alarm buy a clock if you need a alarm.The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it,the sound is as good as the other phones I have had.As for service I have had every carrier that is in the state of Colorado and Nextel is the best and for any one who is thinking of Verizon for push to talk well it sould be push to wait.If you want the best this phone and service is the best. I will not hash over the things that many other wrote in their reviews, but mainly will focus on the problems that I\\'ve had with this phone over the course of 1 year that I\\'ve had it.1) Battery life is not nearly as good as advertised - lasts about 8 hours - but I admit to be using the phone often and need to swap batteries (have an extra one in the charger) because the wire charger would not charge the phone! (another story altogether) However, my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use.2) Familiar problem - phone\\'s earpiece is too quiet.3) Software\\'s pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive, it would save phone numbers under different people\\'s names! No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings. And it wasn\\'t Sprint service either - T-mobile and Sprint are equivalently bad.5) Setup - very panful to readjust setup options/ringers.Overall, I don\\'t like this phone at all. Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless, but still cool) camera.And, judging by Motorolas of my friends (Nextel models aside), I don\\'t think I want to own another Motorola product. When\\'s the new Treo coming out again...? A phone which has got lots of very useful features and functions.Pros:Very Good reception. Works great inside buildings.Clear beautiful color screen and camera. One of the best out thereCons:The buttons are kind of small and needs getting used to.Little bulky if you compare it to a Samsung flip phones. But does things better than the Samsung. The front screen went out on my S105 and T-Mobile wanted me to buy another phone since my warrenty was up.  From the deal I\\'m seeing on here, i wish i could have just canceled and got a new account, but thats too much effort.... anywho, my choices boiled down to getting the E105 or this v300.  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS.She was wrong!  Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!  I\\'m going to have to upgrade my plan to allow more internet usage! There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO.Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two (meaning signal strength).  Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this.  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same.  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105.  If you want more from a phone than just making calls, get the v300 (or higher). I\\'ve been using this phone for a few months now and have had a chance to use most of the features.  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone.  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways.-Decent battery life.  Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that\\'s about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It\\'s very loud if you don\\'t already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I\\'m pretty happy with the phone.  I could\\'ve chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price.  (...)  Can\\'t beat it on value. First a quick confession: I do not like T-Mobile.  I had them before and hated their (lack of) coverage and bad service.That said, the v300 is a very good phone.  I won\\'t rehash the long feature list here.  What I really like (after playing with a friend\\'s) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling.  This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the &quot;girlish&quot; styling, but it\\'s still pretty cool.  Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS... This phone was purchased with the T-Mobile plan to replace a Nokia phone with AT&amp;T.  I changed phones and service because my old phone could not get reception inside of buildings.  I chose the V300 due to the external antennae.  I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased.  The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text.  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose.  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it.  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method.  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.  Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons.  The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall, I would recommend this phone.  The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I think that Motorola needs to darken the text on the buttons for those users who like to text message or who have vision problems. I recently used two of the plug on a trip.  I used the one for Chile and Argentina and they both worked perfectly.  I would recommend this set. They look cheap but work great. I took these on a trip to China and had no problems at all. UPDATE:The person actually using these adapters (an 80 year old grandma) just reported from Bassano Italy that they worked just find and she charged her phone with no issues. So if a octogenarian can deal with something, that speaks volumes to the product!In her case, she was using an iPhone overseas, so any issues of power converters were moot. All she had to do was plug the US style plug into the adapter. Even so, it did work for her and she did it on her own. So that is a plus!**********************************These little adaptors look like they are well made and the price was right.i will add more when I get back! Bought this for a trip to Europe (Netherlands) and it worked perfectly without any kinks. I am quite pleased with my purchase. I was happy with this purchase. Just returned from a Europe trip where I used this to convert and charge my electronics (Iphone, Ipad 3) and was very impressed.I was concerned it might fry my Ipad 3, but I was assured by an Italian gentleman in an electronics store, that it would be just fine, and it was!So I recommend this. I bought this set of adapters specifically for a trip to Europe. There are two different Europe plugs, I took them both, and they both worked everywhere I went.I used the adapters primarily in Denmark and Norway, they worked great and gave me no problems charging iPod, iPhone, iPad, camera batteries, etc.Note that there are numbers on the plugs, the numbers correspond to the cardboard insert to let you know where to use the plugs. It would be better if the plugs themselves had that information on them, but at least they have the numbers (which I didn\\'t see at first so I put my own numbers on them).I will undoubtedly keep using the adapters on future trips, and I\\'ll keep this updated.Update:Have also now used in Thailand, worked great. Works as it is supposed to, lightweight, compact, and very economical.  Covers nearly every plug Ive ever needed in Asian except for India. A few months ago, Sabrent sent me several samples of car inverters to try out, and I have been pleased with all of them so far. This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years. Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market. This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2.1A ports) as well as a standard power socket. Let\\'s cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it\\'s not Sabrent\\'s fault. My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it\\'s actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out. If you\\'re in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price. Recommended for most, reservations for some.  It\\'s no problem charging mobile devices while you\\'re driving, since these devices can be charged from a USB port, either built into the vehicle (newer models) or from USB chargers that fit in the vehicle\\'s power port (aka cigarette lighter). But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter\\'s limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle\\'s electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle\\'s power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner\\'s manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes. Bought this thing years ago and it hasn\\'t stopped working. It was a little noisy but under the seat it was fine. I haven\\'t used it recently because not needing it. A very nice power inverter, especially for the price. Just be aware of the wattage required for what you\\'re trying to run. I purchased this intending to operate a coffee pot, with no result. After doing some research I find a coffee maker needs somewhere around 1000 watts to run. I\\'m standing in a room with a TV blasting, just 10 feet away.  Talking to Hertz reservations - they tell me (a) my voice is the clearest one that they have heard all day and (b) they don\\'t hear the TV at all.  I replace this unit with my old earphone.  \"Now your voice sounds muffled\", he said, \"and I hear that TV now loud and clear\".I have other stories like this.  Walking down a busy noisy street - the Etymonic makes my voice clear and there is no noise of traffic or wind.  My old earphone almost seems to exaggerate the background noise.I use the foam ear piece and it is very comfortable and stays in place.  I don\\'t like the hard plastic ear pieces.Nice. I started using this headset two days ago.  Sound is good.  You can speak at a normal volume level and you will be heard.  I don\\'t use it outside though.  The earplug does give you a sense of being underwater, the way it blocks your whole ear canal.  But that\\'s how it blocks out noise.  I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable.  But, I knew there wasn\\'t when I bought it.  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn\\'t fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I\\'m not comfortable doing that.  It\\'s sensitive equipment, with a filter in the earpiece that I know I\\'ll have to change eventually hence the included tool for same, then it shouldn\\'t be left in the open to collect dust.  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying.  You feel like you\\'re hearing something under water, because the thing is so jammed in your ear (it\\'s a little bit violating...).  I wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset.  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525. The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised.  The trouble is in getting it to stay in place when I move around.  I\\'m not talking about playing tennis here, I\\'m talking about driving the car, and having the boom slowly swing downwards away from my mouth.  The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I\\'m talking with can\\'t hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can\\'t hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I\\'d not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work. As you can see by the picture, this device has merely an ear canal insert and the microphone and cord just dangle.  It feels a little awkward to me, although if you\\'re not moving it does stay in as long as you\\'ve \"pulled your ear back\" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it\\'s not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don\\'t hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It\\'s not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don\\'t find it\\'s much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).  It may be, as someone reported, it\\'s way better for wind noise, I haven\\'t tried that.  It comes with a couple fluffy black sponge wind masks for the mike bulb. This is by far the best wired or wireless headset I\\'ve ever used (over a dozen). It comes with a the headset, a medium length cord with 2.5mm plug, a small and large windscreen, and a 2.5mm-line in/ line out adapter for your PC and a carry case, plus 3 different sized earplugs and a cleaning tool. I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros:Very high quality speaker. Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but you\\'ll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline. It didn\\'t sound as good with HTC and Samsung (CDMA) phones, but this is indicative of the quality of the phone\\'s voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on, you can use it outdoors even in strong wind (20 mph). Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction. It\\'s light enough so it works well. This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket. Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place. It is pretty durable too (sitting on it or dropping it)Cheap - for $35, it performs much better than the Jawbone/Plantronics bluetooth variety without the radiation risk and outperforms high end corded headsets too (call center sets, theBoom)Cons:2.5mm plug. Every modern smartphone uses 3.5mm. Time for an update.Uncomfortable and itchy after extended (4-5 hrs) use. The plugs are made of soft plastic so you need to air out your ear after a few hours (no discomfort then) I have a BlueParrott, but I keep forgetting to turn bluetooth on, or it is paired with something else so I\\'ve been wishing for a wired headset with noise cancelling ability for a long while.  This is it.On my motorcycle you can\\'t hear the engine, and with the windscreen it is good at low speeds (sans windshield - at 30 mph the smaller windscreen starts letting noise through.  You can\\'t hear my stereo blaring.  I would say it is just slightly less able than the BlueParrot - but that might be because the boom doesn\\'t quite reach the corner of my mouth.  But I only have problems if the noise is coming in at just the right angle.It has an isolating insert so it blocks out external noise (you might need an earplug for the other ear in really noisy environments).A few nits:They should have cases for the windscreens - they tend to get squished.  A stereo or dual mono version would be welcome.  The boom could be a bit longer.Only negative is they don\\'t include an iPod/Blackberry/(some)Android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, but I already have several.  They have a VoIP adapter.So maybe not perfect, but this is way beyond all the other \"handsfree\" wired headsets I have used, and it isn\\'t that expensive for what it does. I have bought other USB hubs in the past, and they all failed. plugging in 2 powered devices would make them not work.This USB Hub I have 4 usb powered hard drives and an external DVD burner plugged in and they all work without any problems! This is one of the best Hubs I have found. This usb port is sleek and functional. It is plug and play. It even come with its own power supply in case you have power hungry peripherals. Even though it works fine for me without its own power supply I chose to use it as recommended by the manufacturer. It comes with a lifetime warranty. I have a CyperPower UPS that has been very reliable and I expect this little Cyber wonder to be nothing less. It\\'s a nice-looking product. It seems like I would have liked it. But...My unit had an electrical problem. I connected two portable external hard drives, one powered external hard drive, a printer, an external DVD+-RW drive, a mouse and a keyboard. Then I plugged it in.First I noticed my mouse didn\\'t work. So I unplugged it and plugged in another one. \"That\\'s strange, that one doesn\\'t work either,\" I thought. \"Hmmm, and what\\'s that smell?\"  Turns out, that smell was a hard drive frying.  Once I figured that out I unplugged everything and waited.After a few hours, when I figured everything would have cooled down, I started testing my devices.  One portable external drive still \"sort of\" works. I can see most of the file structure but copying attempts fail. The powered external hard drive mostly worked for a couple days and then quit. One portable hard drive never worked again. The optical drive still works, occasionally, but typically won\\'t boot. Occasionally the printer works. The mice never worked again. And the keyboard was fine.  Everything\\'s been tested on 3 different PC systems and 1 Linux system.The worst part? Those were my redundant data storage. I lost everything. Over 100 reviews all rate theCyberPower High-Speed 7-Port USB Huba good to excellent product for adding usb devices to your PC, Mac; desktop or laptop.  I don\\'t disagree. I think it works as promised, and is well-built by a reputable company that backs its product with a lifetime warranty. I like the solid base and the layout of the device. It\\'s powered (AC) and adds 7-ports to all my computers with plug-and-play compatibility. No driver disc or software to mess with is great.  Mine is already full and it makes me wonder why I waited so long to get it; swapping things out instead of using a hub.So what\\'s wrong with it?  I give this product a 4-star rating only because I can\\'t shut off the blue power light, which is so bright, it illuminates my home office as well as any night-light! Since the room doubles as our guest room, it would be great to be able to shut off that light without unplugging the device. I had more USB adapters then I knew what to do with.  Enter the cyberpower 7 port hub... I am very pleased with it.  I\\'m not a techy, just an every day computer user.  I use my hub with my iMAC and it works seamlessly, have had no issues.  I bought another for a friend and she is pleased as well.  Like I said, it does what it says it will do with little effort, and works quite well for the technically challenged. Okay, this little guy ROCKS!  When plugged in to an outlet, it will support 2 HDDs, a external ODD, and a printer with no issues.  Also, during a move I misplaced my power cord, so I called up the company... WOW, for free, the NEXT DAY, they shipped me out a replacement.  I would DEF. buy from them again, and will use more of these as the need arises.Also, it\\'s been quite some time now since the purchase (over a year) and it works perfectly like the day I got it. i have use this product for 6 months it does a great job, the dlink i used on another system kept losing connection in the middle of transfers i threw it away, this one works.i use lots of usb devices and i have TWO of these on ONE computer and they work fantastic.  when i copy movies to my personal video player from my network hard drives these never fail.  the other ones would stop sending packets in the middle of a trasfer. i have 2 printers, 2 scanners, video capture, mouse, and keyboard, tv, external hard drives, 2 flash card readers, docking for sandisk mpeg player, docking for ipod player, external game system for updating firmware, wacom drawing board for adobe cs3, and other attachments i hook on and off.  these hubs always works.downside, ive had to learn the tricks of windows xp on keeping track of drive letters and changing them around, there are third party programs that i have tried but i\\'d rather use disk manager and do it myself.you will need to do a little cable management because the unit is small and the volume of cables attached to it can physically push it around, but some cable ties or electrical take easily takes care of the problem. I really like this hub.  I have an Acer One Netbook, and I use this hub to power my cd/dvd external drive, my laptop cooler pad, and my 1tb external hard drive.  My cooler pad also has a few usb ports, and I have a 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged into that.  Everything works fine.  Sometimes I have to unplug my cd/dvd drive to get the netbook to read it properly.  I had that same problem with another hub though, so I think it\\'s the drive.  It works more often with this hub than with my other though.This is very small.  The main picture makes it look huge, but it\\'s really palm sized. I took it with me on vacation, and it fit just fine in the carry-on.  You don\\'t need to keep the stand on it.I also like the one port in the front for when I need to plug in a usb drive. I use this hub with my Mac and it is great. I just plugged into my USB port on my MacBook Pro and have never had a problem with it. You can optionally power the device with the included AC Adapter, which lights up a bunch of green lights and one brilliant blue light at the top of the green lights. This blue light is extremely bright for its size and may need to be covered if you are sleeping in the same room with it. I have plenty of open slots for additional devices. If you are using this device vertically in the stand there is a front USB slot for you to attach your flash drive without any effort. Everything (at least with a Mac) is recognized and ready to go once it is plugged in. I would highly recommend this hub - you can\\'t find anything as nice for the price that is powered. I have an older computer with ony 4 usb ports and a laptop with 2 usb ports. I have 4  external drives and a printer and various other devices that require usb, and all i have to do is disconnect it from one computer and plug it into the other and everything Works great. As far as small flash drives that require external power i have no idea.  hope some reviewer will elaborate on that.  In any case its well worth the money.  It stays forever lit, and thats okay.  It will look funny 10 years from now when the lights are extinguished. Great hub.  it\\'s a plug in, which is actually a plus because it came power larger items too.  I have not had any dead usb ports. This little hub seems to be the only brand that does not blow out its ports.  Terrific for dental OP\\'s running digital equipment.  Provides a local hub source for on top of the cabinet when the computer is located underneath.  Easy access, works well and very inexpensive.  Be sure to use the same port for the camera and the same port for the digital x ray sensor and label the ports. Because of proliferation of USB based products, the USB hub is now more neccessary than ever. If you have multiple USB based devices (printers, keyboard, mouse, flash storage, USB speakers, iphone/ipod jack etc) and want to consolidate all your devices into a one single hub, then this hub does its job well.This devices works equally well both in Windows (Vista) and Mac OS (Leopard and Snow Leopard).It is about half the size of a medium sized hand.Each USB port has its own dedicated LED light. The LED light indicators, however, are little brighter than I would like. It MAY bother those who are extremely light sensitive while sleeping. But a cheap way to alleviate such a problem would be to cover the LED lights with tape.I used this device as a hub for all my USB devices for my MacBook Pro (2009) and the device works flawlessly, including for my USB speakers. I use this on my MacBook so I can connect several items at the same time including a USB keyboard and optical mouse, my iPad and iPhone, a webcam, an external hard drive and even a light o Rama controller for my Christmas lights. This thing works great and provides plenty of power for all devices. I haven\\'t seen any slowness in my webcam, iPad/iPhone syncing or even copying large movies to my external hard drive. This guy works great and I am not at all disappointed in performance. I am however a bit disappointed in the design. This has to sit on the corner of my desk and i need plenty of room on both sides to allow the USB cables to plug in. I would have had them design it like a tower with the plugs all on the back one on top of another. That being said, the current design does offer some added stability to keep the hub from falling over. Overall a great performer and a decent design. Does what it\\'s meant to do, the light in the front seems like their only for looks, their always on. Bought this for my Magic Jack, always hearing an echo & the call ID doesn\\'t always work. Echo seems to be fixed now, but still have problems with the caller ID. I also use it for charging my PS3 Sony bluetooth headset & controllers. I was surprised to find this excellent powered USB hub for much less money than I paid for an identicel one over three years ago. Somehow, we misplaced the power adapter so I ordered this one mainly so I could get the power adapter. The older hub still works fine so I just use the adapter so I can run USB 3.0 Hard Drives with a TV Android mini-pc. My grandson wanted the hub for his his Playstation 3 slim, which sees a lot of use. He uses it for video gaming and for a multi-media center. He accidently damaged one of the two USB ports and he was limited by having only one USB port.I gave him this hub. He is so happy with it his friends want one! It is reliable & works well with the power adapter. But with all cables plugged in it tips easy & is far too bright for bedrooms. So for the actual function it is 5stars. But for other considerations it is about 2.5 stars. So, even though it is only USB2 (not the faster 3) I give it 3.5 stars. I used to be a USB doubter - I thought USB wouldn\\'t catch on.  Was I ever wrong!  Without a hub, I wouldn\\'t have enough USB ports to plug everything in!Over the past several years, I\\'ve gotten a number of USB hubs to handle the problem.  I bought a 7-port CyberPower Hub from another vendor to use at work.  It\\'s lasted with day in and day out use for about two years.  One heavy use is that I use a password manager on a USB thumbdrive and it gets plugged in at least twice a day.  The CyberPower hub at work doesn\\'t seem to mind.The hubs at home, and even the USB ports on my motherboards, seem to loosen up and not keep a good grip on the USB thumbdrive.  So, when my home hub flaked out again, I decided to get a hub that I know works, and keeps on working, for use at home.The only drawback to the hub is the LED\\'s on it.  They are a little too bright, and not really all that useful.  However, it\\'s not a problem at work, and at home, the hub is hidden behind a monitor.  I wouldn\\'t want to use it in a bedroom.If you\\'re looking for a reliable hub, this is it. I gave this 3 stars because it does what it says, its nothing high end and doesn\\'t promise miracles, but I won\\'t give it 5 stars because simply there\\'s a terrible delay from when my computer comes out of sleep mode and from the time it actually recognizes this hub on the com ports for the PC, on average its about 15 seconds.  So I\\'ll be sitting there waiting to enter my password like an idiot until the hub is finally recognized by the PC.  And its a really good PC, brand new, no problems with USB 2 or USB 3 except where this hub is concerned. I bought this one based on all the good user reviews and its popularity.  I had to replace an older D-Link USB that just didn\\'t seem to work at all on both our mac\\'s and PC\\'s (I had two D-Link\\'s).  I had hoped this Hub would actually work unlike the D-Link hub and it does the job great!I bought two and hooked one up to the PC and the other to the Mac and plugged 7 devices into each.  Everything worked and I did use the power just to make sure I could charge off of it if I wanted to.  This hub works perfect and the LED\\'s look awesome.Very happy with this product and would buy same one if I needed another USB hub.  Of course I\\'m sure the 3.0 versions will soon start to proliferate but until then this is a great USB hub and priced well for what you get. 1. The USB ports on the sides are spaced far enough apart that I can use all the slots. And the one in front is great for the thumb drive.2. The lights are cool3. It works great4. It stands up most of the time! when I came into the office this morning it was on it\\'s side but no biggie. I righted it and it was fine all day.The weighted base does make a difference and I think they made it as heavy as they could without taking away the portability feature.5. Did I mention it works great. My laptop had no problem going to sleep. It was instantly recognized. All the devices I\\'ve put on it have been recognized6. I don\\'t know what one reviewer meant by it making noise. Mine is absolutely silent.7. I agree you need a scissors or knife to open the clamshell packaging no biggie.I liked it so much I bought a second one!! Easy to use.....you can see clearly by the function lights if the unit is on and if a port is active.  Have been using this now for over a year and it is still going strong. Product is as good as it was advertised. It works very well and I would very much recommend this product because it would give you more usb access to your laptop or desk top. Problem:It seems there\\'s always something else to plug in to a USB port on my laptop, but I\\'ve long since run out of ports for plugging.  In desperation, I bought a 4-port hub (working just fine, thank you), but I still did not have enough ports to do the job.  And the idea of daisy-chaining was not practical because my desk is already overloaded.Solution:Enter the CyberPower 7-port hub.  Space-saving solution to running out of ports.  And, with its own power supply, it\\'s not draining power from my laptop.  Works like a charm!I did find the glow light annoying, but it\\'s easy enough to unplug the hub when I finish working in the evening, so it\\'s not a big issue for me.I\\'m a happy camper now, and I whole-heartedly recommend this hub for those who need more ports in a small space.  I should also commend Amazon for super-fast delivery.  Problem solved!P.S.  Mikey is my cat.  He likes this hub and shows it by periodically knocking it off my desk.I would prefer that Mikey didn\\'t like it! This is an excelent USB port it has the option for it\\'s power . Ether pluged in an A/C outlet or power from your device\\'s nice option A very good high quality USB hub. Windows recognizes everything you plug into this hub and, the USB ports are nice and tight.I will say in my opinion, for a USB 2.0 hub, the Cyberpower-CP-H720 is at the top of the quality hub chart. You can plug a DVD player or web cam into this thing and it will work perfectly. My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine. The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well. This is a great hub and has been good for several months. Highly recommend and will buy it again for additional needs. ok, so this is only a USB 2.0 hub, not a 3.0 hub, but if your computer only supports USB 2 then this is all you need. Plug count/location is as follows:Along the left and right sides (3 per side) It has 6 USB female type A receptacles (this is the bigger USB connector you normally find on a PC)On the front near the bottom, there is a 7th USB type A receptacle  (at the bottom of the unit when it\\'s in the stand) a USB mini type A receptacle (to connect the hub to the computer)and finally on the left side there\\'s a power input for the external power supply.I\\'ve had this hub in use for almost a year now and it\\'s held up very well to multiple plug/unplug cycles. The blue LED at the top is unnecessary to indicate power as there are the other green LEDs for each port. I\\'ve used the plugs for keyboards, mice, HDDs and thumb drives. I\\'ve never had any problems.Overall it a solid and small hub and recommended if all you need is USB 2.0 and up to 7 plugs. [Apart from minor issues like stability of the \"weighted\" base, this hub has been such a consistent, heavy-duty performer, while holding its price point (just short of 30) for exactly 4 years, that I\\'ve had to award it 5 stars (and order the identical model for my wife).  But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they\\'re drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That\\'s fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer\\'s desktop with each start-up.  I\\'m about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what\\'s going on and whether there\\'s a fix (could it be Apple\\'s latest update to OSX?  I\\'ll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon\\'s picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I\\'m looking at the CyberPower USB port \"in person,\" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It\\'s a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you\\'ve got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer\\'s credit, it\\'s one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I\\'ve seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it\\'s a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to \"fatten up\" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest \"gripe\": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I\\'d look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it\\'s so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there\\'s any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the \"cuteness\" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This \"off brand\" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington \"round mound\" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I\\'ve had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.] For one, this product is built very cheap. This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working...why? I\\'m not really sure...perhaps cheap components, and slight bending?Secondly, it does not support charging, and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you\\'ll get an error, but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub, it\\'s a 2.0. Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future. For instance, my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly: Mine is just about destroyed, because of a slight drink mishap. Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than...it stops working from time to time, and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes: The Stand is horrible. It won\\'t stay on, especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable. (It falls out easily, it does not snap on, it\\'s basically just a slightly heavy stand that it \"rests\" on top of. (Useless)- It glows neon Blue. Why? I\\'m not sure. I like it because it matches my setup, but it\\'s very bright, and I\\'d rather the \"power\" be used towards the other devices.Finally: This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time....I would get 3-4 to work...maybe.... at any given point. Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to \"not work\" entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with. This also made me think there was something wrong with my device, and wasted my time trouble shooting. (just had to switch ports) In other words...don\\'t buy this device...get a cheaper hub with more slots, or a 3.0 hub with more features.This is cheap... This is a really nice USB 2.0 hub. It works way better than the 7-port DLink it replaced. The LED lights are a bit bright, but for me it\\'s not much of an issue since the hub lives down on the floor in my setup. I agree that it would be nice to be able to to turn them off though if it\\'s too bright, just cover over them with a strip of tape-problem solved.I am impressed with this hub and would recommend it.Note-it is actually smaller than it looks in the pictures. My my newLogitech G11 Gaming Keyboard (Black/Silver)did not work when I plugged it onto myD-Link DUB-H4 High Speed USB 2.0 4-Port Hub.  After researching a bit, I bought the CyberPower one and now the keyboard works fine.  In fact, lots of other usb things now work without being plugged directly into the computer.  I\\'m quite happy with it. I needed a self powered USB 2 hub for my iMAC, and selected the CyberPower.It works as advertised and comes with its own plug-in power supply.  I can leave my Palm TX hooked to it even when the computer is off and it will charge it.  The only drawback is that the thing is loaded with eight LED\\'s and they stay on whenever it\\'s powered either by the computer or by its own power source.  If you have the thing in your sleeping area and are light sensitive, you\\'d have to unplug it. This device is wonderful, very light weight and portable and works excellent. I purchased as a replacement USB hub for use on my laptop and very much like that you can tuck it anywhere easily. Great quality product. I\\'ve had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.  The only disappointment so far has been battery life.  Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don\\'t really talk on it that much.Why is this phone so great?  Simple.  It has it all.  This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you. OPERATION: It\\'s like BMW\\'s I-Drive - It does it\\'s job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface. For example, the memory card is under the battery. The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while. This is representative of the entire phone operation. Not for the impatient.If you\\'ve never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn\\'t. Even the instruction booklet is out of order.APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open. No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications. On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac. Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor. I\\'m not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I\\'m not sure I\\'d want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.DEPENDABILITY: I\\'ve seen no glitches. I\\'ve had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn\\'t bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little \\'Braille,\\' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.As for appearance, well, that\\'s subjective. Few will look at the phone and know it\\'s \\'all that\\'. It\\'s not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung. Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips, the device isn\\'t really so big. Solid, squeak-free, large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless. First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc. Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires. Still not sure? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well. This is no small deal. If you\\'re still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier. The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true \\'world phone\\' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850). The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia. The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas. As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness. Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it\\'s feature-rich w/ 65k colors. It films 10 second video, for crying out loud. The battery life can\\'t be very long; let\\'s not be greedy.GAMES - Java. Don\\'t use them, so I delete them for addtl space. In my humble opinion, games, along w/ \\'flip phones\\' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia\\'s site. There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost. The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone. If you expect to be able to pick things up when you\\'re out and in a rush via common sense, many times you\\'ll end up frustrated. A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price. Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number \\'along side\\' and \\'beneath\\' them... for every \\'save,\\' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable. It\\'s a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn\\'t easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don\\'t need so many features. Positives: Bluetooth, IR port, VGA Camera, multiple e-mail accounts, speaker phone, more programs becoming available for Symbian O/S. I use Bluetooth for wireless headset and to make the phone serve as my wireless modem.Negatives: phone too big; voice recognition worthless, low volume from ear piece, IR port weak so TV remote control programs don\\'t work well, slow menu\\'s and response. Get Opera browser if your phone does not come with it since the WAP browser will only frustrate you (Opera has problems on this phone, but works most of the time). T-Mobile programmed the backlight in the display to turn off after a few seconds, although Nokia made it adjustable, and T-Mobile won\\'t fix it. Its been 11 months now that I\\'ve held on to my Nokia 6600 for. I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I\\'m a techy and like getting technical about things so I\\'d brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There\\'s a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I\\'ve dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn\\'t the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn\\'t do that because it\\'s not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there\\'s a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn\\'t please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied. This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS! I have been waiting to finish my 1 year contract to get this phone. i did find some bad reviews about 6600. but let me tell you folks its a awesome phone. I have a Palmone T3 and i am really having a good time with both now. neeed to try sync option soon. over all i am much satisfied. giving 4 stars cause the keys are placed little odd. thanks nokia This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer). My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web, you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots, this phone will probably satisfy you. If you need Bluetooth, stay away. It works OK, although several folks have said that it was hard to hear me.  Not everyone, though, so there could have been other factors.  The thing I like least is that it is hard to put on.  Maybe it is just me.  I\\'m accustomed to using headsets, but haven\\'t found a quick way to put this on one-handed. For the money these are great. I use these for a home based business and they get a years worth of abuse in a month. That being the case one will last me between 3-18 months then the wire will develop a break (normal) but at these prices I can toss the bad and replace on the cheap. Jabra makes, by far the best hands-free devices on the market. The EarWave Boom is a good model that will satisfy 90% of people who need hands-free functionality for their cell phones.Jabra has gotten away from the full molded ear gels for this model.  I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels, but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around.  It\\'s comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack. That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug. Calling this \"Universal\" is a little bit of an overstatement, but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by. Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine.  For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with \"Noise Cancelling.\"  It\\'s about $7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm. For those who don\\'t like the microphone arm, the Jabra EarWave Bud doesn\\'t have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt. Personally I don\\'t like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models.  The differences are mainly in comfort, style, and ease of use.  This product is decently priced, but I think it could be more affordable.Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.  This is a pretty good model though, definitely enough to satisfy most users. Good, I was happy with this product.  I got tired of accidentally keeping my bluetooth earpiece in my jean pockets and sending them through the wash, so I bought this and it worked great until I bought a car that had bluetooth built-in. I got this because I had to use a non-Bluetooth cell phone for a while and I prefer talking hands-free.PROS: Confortable.  Very good sound quality. Cheap. Fits in my ear well enough that I\\'m able to keep the phone volume very low and still hear just fine.CONS: Corded.I\\'ve since gotten my Bluetooth phone back, but still keep this around in case the Bluetooth has problems. Used this to replace an original with an old cell phone.  You can\\'t beat the price and lasted years.  Thanks. The Pros:The function and design of this headset are first rate. Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying \"headset signal weak - switch to handset?\"The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is \"connected\" (from Activesync\\'s perspective).  You will hear a constant \"crackling\" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don\\'t have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just \"disconnect\" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The \"hanging\" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn\\'t help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.  Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5\\' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.  I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes.  If you have small earlobes (rather than pendulous ones) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here.  I wish I had... I received this little gem for Christmas and now I refuse to speak into the phone itself.  This BT enabled unit is the perfect gift for anyone with a cell phone.No more complicated setups.  As soon as I turned this on, my Nokia found it, recognized it, associated it, and I was speaking into it.The battery life is great and the clarity is also dead on.Once you use this product, you too will never go back to speaking into your phone the old fashioned way. i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it, but what i didn\\'t test out was the reception/range. i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it, EXCEPT for the fit. it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn\\'t hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours, i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don\\'t know if it\\'s all the electrical devices running in my apartment, but damn, i can\\'t get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically, count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra\\'s warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device! and your microwave. and your electric fans...and running water...they all make reception horrible. i think my problem might have been the wireless home network. but c\\'mon people, us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks. duh.summary:pros:*lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ($42 shipped for new)*easy to usecons:*range, range, range! this is a huge one for me. if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time, what\\'s the point?*too costly at $80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit. you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say, it\\'s for sale on ebay! I\\'ve been using my Jabra headset for a couple of weeks and have been very pleased with it. I bought it primarily for use while driving. It\\'s very comfortable to wear. It has performed extremely well in the car. At times, I\\'ve used it at home. The range of the headset is quite good, but I get more static in my apartment. From time to time, I lose connection with my phone. I suspect that it\\'s more a problem with my phone than with the headset...I only wish that the phone would come with a charger for the car as this is where I (and perhaps most people) will use the headset. In any case, I can highly recommend the Jabra headset. I bought 2 of these headsets (one for me and one for the girlfriend) on recommendation by my Cingular sales guy. It was either the BT250 for $80 or the Moto HS810 for $99.Not knowing too much about Bluetooth headsets at the time, I opted for the BT250. Two weeks later and I\\'m giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I\\'m sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don\\'t have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it\\'s one thing I would REALLY like, then it\\'s a replaceable [rechargeable] battery. I\\'d really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.Regardless, I have found the BT250 to be a better value than the HS810. I owned two versions of this unit. One with the Nokia 3650 (apparently the 3650 requires a specific type as compared to some of the other BT phones) and the second one that I currently own is with the Motorola V600.This comparison will cover both Jabra units and will compare them to the Nokia HDW-2 Blutooth adapter as well as the Motorola HS-820 bluetooth adapters.The jabra unit boasts a much better design. The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward. The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room. The reception was about the same for both (not use-able). I also noticed that when I went around the corner, I would lose the signal. true for all units.All in all, I would rate each one as follows on a scale from 1 to 5:Quality : jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-2.5Design: Jabra-5, Nokia-1, Motorola-1usabaility (range): Jabra-3, Nokia-3, Motorola-3usability (ease of use): Jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-3Overall: Jabra-4, Nokia-2, Motorola-2One thing i did not get to test was the battery life. Jabra did provide a good two and a half days of battery time with a single charge. i did not get to test the battery life of either Nokia or Motorola units. Paired with a nokia 6230. Awesome headset. The battery life is pretty long. It feels really light on your ear and the sound is excellent.Some of these people must be going deaf or something because this thing can get loud. I never have the volume at max when I use this. And if this thing feels heavy on your ear, you must have ears the size of nickels. Or you\\'re using two of them on the same ear...i don\\'t know.Whenever I use this I sometimes forget I have them it until the unit rings... which makes me twitch because I\\'m not expecting a ring blasting thru my ear.I hate:-wind noise. You can\\'t carry a conversation when you\\'re driving with the windows down. or walking and the wind blowing in your face.-voice dialing may or may not work.-it makes my phone hang and reset. but that could be a phone problem in general.-30 feet? more like 10. 15 at best. I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died.  Actually, I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it.  I was impressed with the advertised battery life, and took the plunge.  Shouldn\\'t have.  While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn\\'t it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line.  On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker.  That\\'s about it.  Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something.  I am trying the Motorola next.  This thing is trash. I\\'ve had this headset for about a month now and at first I was very satisfied. I like the shape, it\\'s comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I\\'m not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician\\'s tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I\\'d still buy it, no problem there, but I can\\'t give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight. I picked up this headset the other day and I\\'m relatively pleased with it. Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15\" Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn\\'t in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn\\'t amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I\\'m not sure I\\'d actually keep it on my belt. However, it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.All in all, it\\'s not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement. I\\'d probably buy it again, having used it for a little while. The light works exactly as expected.  As long as you are using your headset then the light will indicate that you are on the phone.  I do wish that the lights were a little brighter, or possibly multicolored.  We have an individual in the office that is color blind to red, so that would have been a nice touch.Also for obvious reasons, if you are using your handset, this light is not on.  I wish that the lifter had a feature that recognized when the handset was lifted by hand.  But that is a wish, not a product defect.Overall, I am happy with this device. Plug it in, stick it high on the wall above you, tape a Post-It \"ON PHONE WHEN LIT\" and you\\'re done.Nobody\\'s bothered me since!  The nice thing is even lifting the headset from the cradle activates the lights, so I can choose to avoid being disturbed even when I\\'m not on the phone. If you don\\'t have your own office and/or you have co-workers who have a tendency of indiscriminately interrupting, pointing to flashing lights will effortlessly embarrass them into not interrupting you when you are on the phone!  In my case I bought the light as a courtesy to my co-workers; I am the first one in the office to wear a headset and they were uncomfortable approaching me whenever I was wearing it.  Now there is no question whether I am on the phone or not.  Easy to install, plug into lifter and place for greatest visibility (cord is about 5 feet long, secure with screw or double stick \"squares\"). This item is awesome.  The two drawbacks are:1) The random light patterns are just weird, I wish I could set it to just one pattern, or to just blink regularly, or to just be on when the phone is engaged.2) Plantronics\\' website lists this as compatible with all of their wireless headsets, however it is not compatible with their CS60-USB.  So when I moved to a soft-phone, I had to give up this gem. Easy to use and set up, works reliably, but in my workplace people walk in and see me facing away from the door, don\\'t notice the light and start talking to me while I\\'m on the headset. I\\'d like to see Plantronics come out with a brighter or larger LED version, but otherwise, it works as advertised... now about those darn co works that don\\'t pay attention to it, I don\\'t know how to fix that! Magnetic mounting is a joke.  It is guaranteed to fall over, scratch your roof and generally be a pain in the buttocks.I wish this antenna were offered with a NMO mount.  It would be very nice to mount this securely, and well worth the trouble and effort to achieve a good mechanical and electrical connection to an auto roof. This antenna works well but the mini is better.  The main complaint is the wind whistels through the coil, so it must be set way back on the roof.  No sound from the mini dual band version and just as good reception.Update 5-28-10: Actually, the mini has much better reception The only thing was that I wish the cable was like 5 ft longer. It doesn\\'t exactly reach where I want it to go with out an extension. I tried a yagi antenna with my repeater, but never got a signal. I finally put this up on my metal (ground plane) roof. 2 or 3 bars inside, even though a phone outside in the same place has only 1 bar. Downgraded some because everything Wilson makes requires an adapter to plug into something else. Be sure you get the right adapter. Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster, and it is not the right antenna. Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it. This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon\\'s problem. I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so, but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception.  Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry.  There is not excuse for this as Amazon has been told many times by Wilson Electronics that they are sending customers the wrong product. I needed a second antennae for my Wilson Sleek cell booster so I could leave one with my vehicle and the other at my weekend residence for convenience. This antennae matched with the Sleek booster exceeded my expectations for strengthening a weak cell signals where I often find myself. This was definitely easy to install. It can be removed and transferred from one vehicle to another. Adds just enough gain to work great. Very please with the antenna but had to buy extra adaptor for it to fit my booster. Should have a bit more info. They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it won\\'t pick up any signal! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker!  I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn\\'t get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren\\'t any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn\\'t go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it. The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal. I don\\'t see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this, they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints. I\\'m sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great. This one must have been defective. This didn\\'t do much for me. Unfortunately, it may not be the blame. Ironically, I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes (I thought). This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution. So in the mobile world, I\\'m sure this would be helpful. It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage, location, type of usage, cell frequency and more. So in putting a system together, for a whole home solution, you\\'d be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not \\'fit\\' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system. This headset was a piece of junk right out of the box. I had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day. I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn\\'t really as \"standard\" as one might hope!) However, it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn\\'t care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).  The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase, so I don\\'t know why it is proving as fragile as it has.  If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed, it is a good choice.  Otherwise, I suggest looking at other designs. On the positive side the battery life is good.The negatives I\\'ll split into ergonomics, sound and RF performance.Ergonomics: It\\'s secure on my big ears, but as others have mentioned that seal is nothing more than marketing and window dressing. There aren\\'t many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don\\'t have good hearing this isn\\'t going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can\\'t answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it\\'s connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I\\'d keep looking, which is why I\\'m browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven\\'t yet found a \"good\" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I\\'d pay a couple of hundred bucks. A decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice while standing between the exhausts of a 1500hp tank engine. This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever, I\\'ve been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well ----- however, the connection speeds take forever to establish ---- in addition, the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 --- I\\'ve heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary.....UPDATE: I have also tried the Moto 850 ---- sadly, it is really no better than the 810 --- there are some volume improvements, but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 ---- I recommend the Scala 500 I have had this headset for several months now, and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK, but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect, ie. no background or wind noise, and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off, when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset, I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws. This headset was purchased to replace TWO crappy jabra freespeaks.  This is very small, but unlike the goldlatern bluetreks or the Jabra, does not hide its mass well; it all sits right outside your ear, and in completely inconspicuous.  With my old bluetrek and even the jabra, my hair hid most of it, which for me is a plus, as I do not use Bluetooth headsets to impress people or get atttention; I don\\'t want peoples attention and questions.Which is this headsets only drawback - it has this HUGE, BLUE ORB-LIKE LIGHT on it that takes up the whole front of the piece.  YOU WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION with this headset on.  It blinks in standby, it blinks when in operation, it blinks all the dang time.  But, if you can get passed that, it does work pretty well.  The sound is a little tinny, but pretty clear.  And unlike all my other bluetooth headsets, the headset volume only operates the headset, and doesn\\'t link to the phone volume - this means that you have more adjustability for volume level and loudness, which is good.  The mic seems really good - no complaints from those on the other end, basically.  And the battery life isn\\'t TOO ugly at 5 hours.  And the ear anchor could be a little more rigid and smaller for smaller ears, but it will do as long as you are not jogging around constantly. This product appears to be a genuine original equipment Blackberry car charger.  It has the Blackberry name and logo on it.  The plate on the bottom of the cigarette lighter plug of the unit states that the electric output is 5 volts, 500mA (500 milliamperes or .5 ampere).  The plate on the wall charger packaged with a new Blackberry 8800 states that the wall charger output is 5 volts, .75 ampere.  Thus, it appears that the car charger produces two thirds the electrical charge produced by the wall charger (.5 vs. .75 amp.)This car charger is used with a Blackberry 8800 and has performed admirably and without any problems.  It costs a fraction of the price charged by AT&T; ($29.99), apparently for the same product. Since BB battery does not last too long, I plug in my BB car charger into my BB every time I\\'m in my car. This keeps my BB charged all day long. A must for every BB owner out there. Love it works great never had a issue with it at all would buy a million more ifi needed them It works fine. I like it if I have any problems I will update you. I have been using my Blackberry Curve for almost 2 years and only 3 times have I been able to run the battery to empty in one day. This car charger works as you would expect it to so if you\\'re more addicted to your Blackberry then I am (and I am fairly glued to mine) this charger will keep your thumbs moving even longer then they probably should :) . I bought this to fit inside a kit that creates a storage space below my car stereo.  The pad has good grip on an ipod, my phone, and a couple pens while sticking to the smooth plastic. These things are great and work for a lot of areas, not just the car.  I actually use them on my art table to keep my items from moving that I use. works great This pad is extremely unreliable in that it does not stick to my dash and is very poorly made. One thing I will say is my wallet and phone have not fallen from the pad. Unfortunately, the pad moves all around. Not only is this sticky pad great to keep things from sliding but you can trim it to fit an area or \\'shelf\\' on the dash. This pad is really good it works for the porpuse that is described, obvisly of you put something really big or something too round, it is going to fall with any movement of the car, but for the phone, glases, coints, some small papers, etc. it works and is really easy to remove and replace in any part of the car board. Highly recomendable.Note: It also looks nice in black car boards. Nice sticky pad to keep my phone and glasses from sliding across the dash when I turn. How many time have i done that when i take them off to look for a paper or phone charger when driving. Its a bad habit but so is reaching for the glasses across the car and still be driving, but no more. I put this sticky pad on top of a cup holder cover i have on my Honda Accord 2010. I tend to put ipods or my cellphone there and whenever the car moves it slides out and falls to the car\\'s floor. Using this sticky pad, it prevents that for me.It is easy to remove if you decide to get rid of it altogether. You don\\'t have to stick it permanently on any part of your car.Things that don\\'t bother me about it but should be noted.It doesn\\'t stay on the cover that well.Its like it could fall off if there was enough dust between it and the cover.Just like any other sticky thingie, this thing can easily collect dust. It looks like you can just wash it off though. I haven\\'t tried.Update:Yep you can just pull it off, wash it, dry it properly (overnight) and put it back where it was.I bought a 2nd one so that I can put stuff on the dashboard now. So I can use the cupholder. Item was purchased for spouse.  Was not what he really wanted, but the item does work for the most part. I always have triable keeping my phone from moving when in my sports car. I like to keep my phone close to my hands and this sticky pad allows me to do exactly that even when I make a sharp turn. The phone alway stays in place. If it gets a bit dusty, you can wash it and is as good as new again. Works as advertised.  It\\'s a tacky pad that is non-adhesive and keeps stuff from sliding around on the dashboard.  Problem with the iPhone (4S) is that the back is a flat panel of Gorilla Glass and does not lift easily off the Sticky Pad.  Instead, it tends to lift the Sticky Pad off the dashboard by sticking itself to the back of the iPhone.  I\\'m sure the problem would be solved by using an iPhone cover, but then if I did I wouldn\\'t need the Sticky Pad at all. I did take off a star in the rating because products like these are marketed in a slightly exaggerated way.There\\'s nothing &#34;sticky&#34; about the product.  The pad is made of a specific material that is able to hold the objects in place while you\\'re driving.  It\\'s not perfect, but for the simple task of holding a cellphone, sunglasses, loose change, perhaps your EZ-Pass, it will do the trick.I place a camcorder there to film road trips, and for the most part, it stays put.  Like any other product of this type, if you off-road, drive over unpaved roads, or you intentionally drive abnormally, the contents of the pad may not stay put.Summary:  Just drive normally, and you won\\'t have a problem. I keep one of these at my office desk and one at home. It provides a great place to locate my cell phone or bluetooth stereo speaker. No clanging when I lay the items down. No strange echo vibrations from hard surfaces. AND no vibrating off the counter - which had happened before without the pad. Even though the package and description stated there was no adhesive, there certainly was a white backing too remove and place on dash . I felt the item was very thin, and to the touch not sticky at all. There were no groves as competing products and the part that faced up that was supposed to attract and \"stick\" was smooth. Overall, I was not impressed. I bought 10 of these.  They are the worst product I have ever used.  They DO NOT work as advertised.  Nothing sticks to them She used to keep her cell in the side door pocket and was always missing calls & messages, but problem solved.Has never fallen off. I bought a similar one @ a local store & was surprised how well it held my phone, my sons phone & iPod.  I pd almost $6 & it is 1/2 the size of this one.  I needed another one & it looked bigger. Wow!! It\\'s bigger, I have a. Portable fan even on one of these!!  I loved it so much, I bought another one. WARNING.... This has NOTHING to do w/ the product itself, BUT if u use this for your phone, iPod & it\\'s HOT outside & u have this on ur dashboard... DO NOT put your phone or iPod on it!! My phone over heated!!!! Thank goodness it ok my phone.... But u live & learn. I also keep loose change on it... Glasses... Small toys stay too!!!!  Enjoy !! Like so many other reviewers, I had this Think Outside Stowaway \"collecting dust\" as I had bought it for an older phone.  I was actually looking on Amazon for a foldable keyboard and came across this and these reviews.  So I found my Stowaway (quicker than I thought I might!), did not load the software that came with it (as the instructions tell you to do), but just decided to see if it would sync with my Playbook.  First, of course, I had to put 2 AAA batteries in it and, VOILA, it worked!!!  I am a happy camper!!!  As another reviewer said, it is surprising that some other manufacturer hasn\\'t continued this concept in folding keyboards. I just paired this with my Hisense Sero Pro and it works great. I\\'ve tried many portable keyboards but none with this build quality and keyboard comfort. Truly feels like a real keyboard that folds up small. The stand holds my 7 inch tablet well. No more lugging around my laptop. This is all I need. I bought this keyboard when it was first released back in 2005 took it out today to test it with the idea of selling it. But after installing it on my current device (Verizon XV6800 running Windows Mobile 6.1), I decided I liked it too much to sell. I forgot how much I liked this keyboard. I\\'m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1. The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain. I would have preferred another row of keys. It wouldn\\'t have added that much size or weight.2. When the keyboard is open, it\\'s supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings. If you are a slow typist, this is fine. But I\\'m a fast typist and I tend to hit the the keys pretty hard so the keyboard tips from side to side when I type. Really irritating. I fixed this by making two little supports from stacked cardboard glued together. I stick these under the \"wings\" and that solves the problem.Here\\'s where I got the latest driver released for the device (it\\'s no longer supported by iGO):[...]This driver is for Windows Mobile 5, but it works on my Mobile 6.1 device. :)You MUST install the driver in MAIN MEMORY - not a storage card. If you install it on a storage card, it won\\'t work.After I installed the driver, the configuration utility suggested that I upgrade the keyboard\\'s firmware. I thought this wouldn\\'t work since the keyboard is no longer supported by iGO, but to my surprise, it did - my firmware was updated from 1.1 to 1.2.The previous reviewer said he had to use the pointing stick to send email. That\\'s because he didn\\'t know the keyboard shortcut for Send: Alt-S.The keyboard folds up very small and compact and it\\'s very light-weight - not a big deal to carry it around along with my SmartPhone. No more picking at the tiny on-screen keyboard when I want to send email from my phone! The keyboard will connect to an iphone 3GS with iOS 4 but will not reconnect automatically.I did the CTRL + LFT FN + RT FN keys and the light on the keyboard starts flashing.  Then check the bluetooth on the iphone and it discovers the keyboard.  Then when you pair it the iphone will ask you to enter a 4 digit code and press enter on the keyboard.  That part works perfectly.Then you can use the keyboard on the iPhone 3GS.  But when you close the keyboard and the bluetooth connection is broken, it will not reconnect when you open the keyboard back up.  I tried pressing keys and waiting.  I checked the bluetooth status on the iphone and it shows not connected.  No matter what I do it will not reconnect.  I have to manually re-pair the keyboard and phone to get it to work.  That makes the keyboard completely useless on the iPhone 3GS with iOS4.  There is a video posted on youtube where another person had the same problem.If anyone was able to get it to work properly with an iPhone 3GS with iOS4, please let me know how you were able to do it. The driver for this device completely broke my Treo 650, fortunately I have Sprint\\'s insurance plan so I was able to get a replacement Treo. I used the latest driver from the Thinkoutside website. If you have a Treo do not get this device. This is a great Bluetooth keyboard that is very compact and easy to use. It does work for Android and iDevices and has a shelf for you device to rest on so you can see the screen while you type. The iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard is truly portable.  Running on two AA batteries, you can easily carry spares around.  Only gripe about this product is that it lacks a dedicated number row (for 1 to 0).  Else, it would be perfect. I just love this keyboard. I\\'ve used it with my HTC and now with my unlocked iphone using BTstack Keyboard from Cydia. The only issue is that it really needs an extra row of keys. The numbers and symbols are placed on the top row of letters (where the letters QWERTYUIOP are in the keyboard). To access a number, you need to press the left function key and the corresponding letter. To type a symbol, you need to press the right function key and the corresponding letter. I work in finance and many of my annotations need numbers and symbols, like 10% for example. For that, it takes a long time. I find it easier to type \"ten pc\" instead of 10%.I\\'ll buy a new keyboard just for that. But besides this, the keyboard is just amazing. So if you don\\'t need your numbers and symbols too often, I really recommend it. First off, I have had this product since 2007 and was fortunate to catch it at a great bargain!!  Since then, I have not had one problem with it except when I forget to change the batteries!I have been able to successfully pair and use this keyboard with originally a Samsung I760, then a HTC Touch Pro 2 and now my Motorola Xoom tablet.  I was surprised that I didn\\'t even have to download drivers, it worked once I simply paired it.Not having number dedicated keys was a sacrifice but I can type memos, emails or simply work on a novel at anytime conveniently by having this portable keyboard.  The keyboard itself is very durable and has a sturdy feel when you are typing. I purchased this product to send over to my wife who is on a trip, and complained about typing on a Blackberry. I thought I better install it before sending it after her, so I could guide her along. No PC where she is, so I tried to download as advertised. Result: Page Not Found.Company advised that since this is a discontinued item (?) they took down the support pages.This would not be an issue normally - you can install the driver from a PC.It is the principle that a company can maintain a manufacturer\\'s description while not the web page to support the claim...You know a manufacturer is a scumbag when their feedback/survey link gives you an error message back...If any doubts read the blackberry link from the bottom of the review page, or click on the one star reviews. A shame It seems that this keyboard acts a little like those gold fish you bring home in a plastic bag from the pet shop.  You have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it\\'s new surroundings.  I went from wanting to love the thing for the sheer coolness factor....to boxing it up to send back when it wouldn\\'t sync to my Axim x50v....to giving it another chance and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly, I now love it again.  The keyboard is smaller than standard but very useable.  It\\'s great for writing a longer e-mail, inputting contacts, or writing a letter in word, when you don\\'t want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don\\'t want to let go.  The plastic it\\'s made out of doesn\\'t seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it\\'s holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it. I previously gave it one star, but now that it\\'s acclimated and working I give it 4 only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been a full 5.  I know it shows one star, but Amazon wholdn\\'t allow me to edit the scale. Great sturdy design in every aspect. After pairing, it features flawless instant connection to your device every time you open it. A keeper for long, its quality shows it\\'ll last for ages.I just wish iGO would start working on supporting Windows Mobile 6. It does perform as a keyboard should and it does carry out it\\'s core functionality; but, I can\\'t find the drivers for my device or any other WM6 device for that manner. I am currently using similar ones which, though do allow the device to work, don\\'t allow all function keys to carry their purpose or softkey support to be accurate. I have infrared (IR) keyboards to use with my Palm Treo 650 and Palm TX. They don\\'t work very well, at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn\\'t make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway\\'s set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user\\'s manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn\\'t steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a \"universal\" device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn\\'t have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn\\'t show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I\\'m happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today\\'s products. It\\'s plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn\\'t feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit. The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words. Once you get a keyboard for your pda / smart phone, you won\\'t go back. This keyboard communicates via bluetooth and does a great job at turning your small device into a productive tool you won\\'t want to be without. I use this keyboard with my Palm TX and it does a fabulous job during meetings - it\\'s small (smaller than a notebook), VERY portable and reliable. the entire keyboard as well as my Palm PDA fits into the pant pocket of my cargo pants / shorts. You really can\\'t get much more portable than that.To use you invoke a 3-button key combination to help it initiate contact with your device. Once connected, you\\'ll be off and running. My Palm TX will only stay on at 1-3 minute intervals so the only thing I don\\'t like about this combination is that I have to keep hitting a key once in a while so my Palm doesn\\'t shut off. This of course is a design flaw of the TX and not reflective of the keyboard. This keyboard fills my left pocket and my \"Ultra mobile PC phone\" fills my right pocket.  This keyboard allows me to type at normal speed on a device I can keep in my pocket, and I was astonished to see that it would have even worked for text messaging on my older phone, the Nokia N-Gage.  If you have any HTC phone or any phone that supports bluetooth or this keyboard, or even a PDA, I highly recommend this product, although it is costly.  Pair it with anything that can run TextMaker Office for WindowsMobile and you have a meeting powerhouse in your pocket that can tackle the best college note taking in a much more mobile manner than a laptop, since you don\\'t need to take it out of a bag, plug it in, and otherwise waste time.  I also suggest pairing it with the mouse by the same company for the same purpose. I have an older PDA (Dell Axim X50) and this keyboard works great! The connection is Bluetooth and was easy to set up.  It is compact when folded up and very light, yet feels fairly sturdy and responsive when typing. The iGO bluetooth keyboard works great. The only complaint is the extreme left and right tips a little when typing. For the money, this is a great item and a must have for mobile road warriors. I am using the iGo keyboard with a Blackberry Curve (8300).Like others have said, there is a nasty sticker that covers both the outside cover and the keys that may never completely come off. When peeling it off the keys, it feels like the keys will rip off their fragile posts.Also, as is common with Bluetooth, getting the two devices to communicate with one another can be tricky. I haven\\'t used it a lot yet, so maybe I haven\\'t figured out the right combination of button presses. But I hate when things don\\'t simply \"work.\"The keyboard is fairly solid and certainly easy to type on, especially if you\\'re accustomed to typing on a laptop. The keys are marked with several shortcut functions to launch tasks or apps.This is a great item for anyone who wants a lightweight substitute for traveling with a laptop. While sitting in a hotel room checking e-mail, this is all you need. I purchased this keyboard so that I could start doing some serious word processing on my Treo 650, and I\\'ve been absolutely pleased!First off, the keyboard does not come with the Treo 650 driver --- you must DOWNLOAD THIS DRIVER OFF OF THINK OUTSIDE\\'S websiteHowever, downloading the driver is easy, and from there, you can sync it to your Treo, or email it, in an attachment, to itOnce the drive is installed, the keyboard is flawless!My biggest complaint about BlueTooth keyboards is that they lag, as you type ---- but this is not the case with the Stowaway --- every key I pressed showed up INSTANTLY upon my Treo 650So far, it has worked terrificly with my address book, calendar, and email (VersaMail)In addition, the keyboard folds together well and is EXTREMELY thin and portable ---- I don\\'t know if you could carry it in a pocket - but a backpack, briefcase, etc will not feel any extra weight with this productlastly - these keyboards are small --- I wish the delete key was bigger (as I often make typos) but nonetheless, I\\'m very happy, and certainly, typing on this quicker than the phone\\'s keyboardhighly recommended!HAPPY TYPING! HAPPY BUYING! Originally created for use with Palm devices, the iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard for PDAs and Handhelds is still among the best folding, nearly full-sized Bluetooth keyboards available. Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us, these days, I\\'m a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find, particularly on most laptop computers. I\\'ve owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased, nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it\\'s useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There\\'s no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power, too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However, my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type, in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size, in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case, this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn\\'t I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available, I think, only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn\\'t undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems, but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone\\'s operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called \"smart phones\" do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly, this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games, rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn\\'t more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS, Android, and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard, if you are looking for a durable, reliable, and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device. It is so funny watching text fly into my T-Mobile SDA smartphone (aka iMate SP5m or HTC Tornado) using the Stowaway keyboard. This keyboard is all class: just like a laptop keyboard, with the same spring to the keys, quality, durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to\\'able, however symbols such as () and & or % can be a major pain, due to the fact that a) you have to use \"custom\" key commands using ctrl, fn1 and fn2 buttons and b) if you are an experienced typer, you \"already know\" the \"motion\" for & or * or (), and you\\'ll find yourself doing them! (meaning you are incorrect, on this keyboard)That said, entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard, just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it. You will get used to it, just like you got used to fast touch-typing.Anyhow, this thing is a gem for hammering out quick SMS text messages, etc. I mean no more \"click-click-click, clack-clack, click-click-click-click, clack-clack\" to type out a single four-letter word. Nothing feels quite like that lol!This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men\\'s pant pocket. I wear shorts, pants, etc. and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent. I use this in class to quicly type out extensive class notes, as I can type far faster (and more legibly) than I can hand-write.The case is durable sandblasted aluminum (like my old minidisc player) and the detachable device stand is sweet! I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class, and type in my lap. Sweet!Anyhow, is this thing essential? I mean, I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in, say, a statistics class with graphs and stuff...you can\\'t draw graphs with this thing very well. However, for text-based notes in a college setting, this thing is well worth it. A smartphone as above and a keyboard, and you have one of THE major functions of a laptop, but without having to carry a laptop. Just the phone you\\'d have anyways, and this flat little thing.NOTE: if you have troubles reconnecting this thing, use the bluetooth connect on your phone first, then use the special driver provided by Think Outside to finish the connection. Two part process.In all, I am a college student and I wish I did not have to pay over $80 for this unit (why can\\'t they make it for $30?), but in the end this thing is slightly sweeter than it\\'s price, so it\\'s worth it. I struggled with trying to get this thing to work with my Blackberry 8700g for some time.  I even selected and downloaded a driver that was listed for Blackberry devices on the product web site.  After a lot of frustration, I finally got my Blackberry to pair with the keyboard, but it would still not recognize it when I tried to get it to link to it.  I contacted iGo product support and they informed me that: \"Unfortunately, we do not have a driver for that device currently.\"  So, I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly \"for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds.\"By the way, the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices, only with Smartphones.  A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate, in small letters, that it also works for Blackberry.  In my case, though, back it goes, which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it.  In the mean time, I guess I\\'ll keep looking.Lastly, I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit.  It is glued to the keyboard and to the front surface and is quite a pain to remove. I bought this to work with a Palm T3, years ago. They never produced good Palm drivers so it was pretty much worthless. It\\'s been sitting in a drawer for five years and some of the keys stick, but they can be prised up with the corner of a credit card. The keyboard syncs cleanly with an iPad 2 and, if you can tolerate the way it rocks back and forth as you type, it works fine. It always worries me when devices like this are still being sold at retail, while third party sellers are able to sell them for under what wholesale would seem to be for the stated retail price. Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose, it may well be just what you want, despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part, but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I\\'ve considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk, not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips, two weeka later, in the same shape, ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer\\'s web site, I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10, now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270, a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can\\'t use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop, and I was able to use it as a keyboard, without special drivers.  Probably, with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts, but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation, although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12, what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key, how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line, but if you then accidentally hit cntl, you\\'d put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are, as I write this, available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs, Some Smartphones, and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard\\'s future, specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won\\'t be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great, and the PS3 does not use F1-F12, so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it, or type addresses if you are surfing, or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special, I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard, I can\\'t just open it up and start using it. I have to open it, go to applications, start the keyboard application, go into bluetooth configuration, tell it to connect, dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list, and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works, and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don\\'t seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done, so long as the palm does not need to be reset, the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes, the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused, it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key, it will resume communications immediately, without going through the menu. No, it is not a full sized keyboard, and there are some compromises, but it has a really good feel, even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard, the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded, and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop, be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard, a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple, easy to use, and works well. This is not a PC keyboard, and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard. For what it is sold for, it is best of breed. I received the item in a timely manor, but the best thing about this product, was the outstanding response I received by the seller. It was an excellent purchase experience and excellent customer service.  I would buy from this seller again.  I was unable to make the item work with my blackberry 8310, and the seller provided me the opportunity to return it for a full refund, however, my life got busy and the time alloted to return it expired, but that\\'s my fault and not the seller. Use it for my Nokia N95-3 and it works very well.A bit bulky since its not really pocketable but fits in any bags for easy transport.Great for using it on airplanes since it is small and will not take up the entire table.Some keys are very touchy since I noticed that the \"E\" button will press twice.All in all a very nice product! I have the version designed and manufactured for Dell by Think Outside, Inc.  It is the same as this product but the keys are black.  The keyboard works great.  The keyboard folds up flat and is about 4\"x6\" and it is thin.  It folds out to a full size keyboard, when opened the keyboard latches so it won\\'t fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a \"techie\" by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don\\'t know if Think Outside, Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.  It should not only work well but hold up under normal use and parts should be made available and easy to find.-Feb. 21, 2006Update:  I contacted Think Outside Inc. through their website.  They sent me two replacement stands free of charge.  The customer service department was nice and I got the stands within three business days.  Great customer service!-Feb. 24, 2006Another Update:  I am still using the keyboard and it still works great and my replacement stand is holding up and I still have the extra they sent me.  I would purchase this again and I wish sellers like Dell knew to direct customers who experienced the problem I did to Think Outside for replacement parts.  They had excellent customer service unlike Dell (they wanted me to purchase another keyboard).-Sept. 15, 2006 Great ideal for a product, works perfectly and as advertised.  I just think its another item for the bag with the laptop when you are traveling. Works great with my Moto Q.  Typing sound is annoying but easily turned off.I also caution that you should probably store the batteries uninstalled.  I put a brand new set of Duracells in it and they were dead a month later with almost no use (Just sitting in my briefcase)  I discovered this at the start of a 5 hour flight and fortunately was able to cannibalize a set from my MP3 player.  This only happened once so I can\\'t say for sure that the keyboard sucked them dry.What really annoyed me was the \"Fold and unfold\" sticker which had some sort of industrial adhesive.  What a stupid thing to use.  It took me 25 minutes with cleaning solvent to get that darn thing off.  Also the black vinyl zippered pouch stinks like some toxic chemical.  If not for those two things I\\'d rate it 5 stars Long battery life, connects quickly to phone. Phone callers can\\'t even tell I am on a BT headset, no complaints of inablility to hear my voice will on a call. It is not for people with wide necks, does not stretch much. Can slide back when active and the earphones are not in your ears. Otherwise light, controls are easy to reach and distiguish. I have the similar LG HBS730 but prefer these due to the ease of finding the buttons you want but prefer the flexible neck of the LGs. I have had an LG-700 for a few years, and I love it.  But I get complaints from people about the microphone picking up extraneous noises when I am on the phone in a supermarket, or working in the kitchen, so when it started to wear out, I tried this one.  Well....this does have pretty good sound, BUT, the rigid frame for the \"yoke\" is a problem for this guy with a 17.5\" neck.  And the location of the on/off switch is annoying (on the back).  Plus, whereas the LG-700 has 6 buttons, this has 4, and the buttons are sorely missed for all of the needed functions of such a headset.  I often get the \"Equalization changed\" message when I am trying to get Siri to pop up...very annoying!  On the plus side, it does seem to connect to my iPhone quickly, and the signal seems pretty stable.All in all, it is nice...but misses in a few ways.****************Update:  After 3 weeks, I returned this to Amazon.  The fit was just too annoying.  Thank you Amazon, for your great return policies! Pros:1) Excellent call clarity and loudness both ways2) Excellent for listening to music3) Fits snugly and stays put around your neck while exercising (unlike the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730)4) Feels much better than theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 when in contact with your skinCons:1) Connectivity is not as good as with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730, e.g., it does not connect to 2 devices as once and you have to first disconnect it from the device it\\'s currently connected to before it connects to a new device. The LG does not have this annoying problem.2) The power button is located all the way in the back and it\\'s awkward and difficult to power on or off,  unlike theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7303) Does not vibrate when you receive a call4) Does not have easily accessible buttons like the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7305) Does not look as good as the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7306) Does not announce the battery level like the LG7) The battery life is good but subpar to the LGOverall this Bluetooth Headset offers excellent sound quality (as good as you get with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730) but overall it\\'s very poorly and unintuitively designed compared with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 and does not have as good, seamless and versatile connectivityI\\'ve had both for about a month and the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 is clearly the better headset overall.I will be returning this one mainly because I\\'m tired of the problematic connectivity and the very unintuitive design. I bought these to replace my LG headset which kept dropping audio during phone calls.  The sound quality is very good.  It has a longer range than the LG. Overall very pleased.  The software that runs the headset is not as advanced as the LG, it doesn\\'t announce the battery level and it can only be connected to one device at a time.  When it announces it is connected, if two of your devices have bluetooth on at the same time, you don\\'t know which one it is connected to because it does not identify the unit it is connected to.Overall, though, I like them a lot.  The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use. I have been a fan of the LG HBS series since the amazingHBS-700and also own theHBS-730and the newHBS-800.With the SF500, Motorola has clearly taken a more than close look at the HBS series and attempted to improve on it. Here\\'s how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it\\'s much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don\\'t bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That\\'s funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They\\'re not bad, and if the LG series didn\\'t exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they\\'re a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it\\'s disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they\\'re not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be. I was hoping for a blue tooth that will connect to more than one phone. I already had the LG and was hoping the Motorola would do better but I was let down. It is a great buy if you are only using one cell phone. The headset sounds excellent.  The earbuds will not aggravate your ears when they are in... even for long lengths of time.  I would definitely recommend these. Update: I\\'ve been asked how they hold up with sweat (see below). No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I\\'ve not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it\\'s not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I\\'ve used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I\\'m wearing them when I turn on my music and don\\'t hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I\\'m going to work out in them anyway and I\\'ll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I\\'ve used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don\\'t sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren\\'t as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I\\'m not taking away anything by saying they don\\'t sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I\\'d choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn\\'t look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don\\'t hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren\\'t super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren\\'t that bad. Don\\'t wear them to a job interview. Pro\\'sUnit has great range.Comfortable in the ears, can wear it all day.Battery life is awesome.Mute function make this very useful for someone that spends a lot of time on the conference calls.Con\\'sLasted two months and now will not turn on anymore. Trying to get motorola to fix it, but no help so far.Audio books may have issues. The headset will cut out during short pauses and makes you lose out on a few seconds of the story as it reconnects. Only certain books caused this behavior.If it did not quit on me I would certainly recommend it as a phone headset. I can walk away father than the next leading one and it doesn\\'t fade out even thru some of my thickest walls It\\'s so so.  Not as comfortable as advertised and hugs your neck which i hate.  Has great sound but  is quite plain. I own an older LG model bigger for guys my size.... Has more control buttons for the different functions compared to the 2 buttons the Motorola has.The off/on button is in a bad place, every time I lay on the bench to lift weights I lay on the button which shuts it off ...Poor design. I wouldn\\'t say not to buy it but a gadget person as myself I prefer the LG so I returned the Motorola and ordered a newer LG model .. These ear buds are just wonderful.  Let\\'s you listen privately to anything you need to and still participate in daily activities.  I would highly recommend. I bought these after TWO sets of LG Tones broke on me. I like these a lot. Very comparable to the Tones. What was most important to me was battery life. I used these for listening to sports and talk radio. I have wired buds for listening to music. The only two complaints I have with this item is: the neck band is kinda tight in comparison to the Tone. Not as easy to get on and off. However, they don\\'t move around as much as the Tone\\'s. My second complaint: the on/off. I have to take the headset off to access the switch. The Tone\\'s switch is a much better setup and easily accessible. All in all, I would recommend these. I am hoping the quality is better than that of the LG Tone. VERY COMFORTABLE, CLEAR VOLUME AND GREAT FITTTING AROUND YOUR NECK. DON\\'T TURN AROUNDYOUR NECK AS MUCH AS THE LG. GREAT I lost my 2-year-old LG Tone HBS-700 headset and someone else is doubtless enjoying it.The Motorola cables appeared to be more robust than the LG cables and the price point was attractive compared to the newest LG HBS-800, so I decided to take a chance.The good:- price- earbud fit- strong cables- battery life- reception- button function and placement- pairing- telephone functionThe bad:- looks goofy- the band is a tight fit- two-tone cable color may as well be illuminated with a sign that says, \"look at me!\"The mediocre:- sound quality (richness and frequency response) simply cannot match the LG Tone HBS series- equalizer is not very effective (bright treble but non-existent bass)Summary:This product is inferior to the LG where it counts:  the sound.  For me, that is sufficient reason to warrant return of this product and purchase of the newest and ridiculously expensive LG Tone HBS-800.  I am returning the Motorola this week, but I will delay my purchase of the LG until the price becomes more reasonable.  In the meantime, I\\'ll get by with a wired pair of earbuds. My LG HBS-730 that I use for bike rides with no problem.  Recently, the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can\\'t enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it\\'s stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try.  Wow, I don\\'t know what kind of power they use, I had three rides so far and I haven\\'t experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up, no phone call conversation break up.  It\\'s so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time, I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn\\'t hear me.  I don\\'t know if it\\'s the other party or the headset.  The party calls me back and this time, when I press the pickup button, the headset doesn\\'t respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles, it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.  This keep the earplug from swinging back and forth when I am not using it.  I don\\'t know if this is by design or just accident.  Either way, it\\'s cool. SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I\\'m probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I\\'ll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It\\'s fine if I\\'m looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the \\'outside\\' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I\\'ve gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone\\'s music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I\\'ve got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they\\'ll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn\\'t listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola\\'s site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn\\'t like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can\\'t do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed. An excellent device works great and fits well in your ear .... truly useful while driving and when you have your phone in your pocket. Was shipped well and in time by amazon This bluetooth did not last me a year.  I called Motorola for a replacement.  They sent another model and I\\'ve been using it for four years now. It worked good for a few months.  Gradually, it began loosing its quality. People have trouble hearing now.  I am also getting \"static\" and cannot use very much.  Works a little better in my cell phone than Skype.  Overall, I do not reccommend it. When I first received this product it worked well.  After a month and a half it stopped communicating with my cell phone. I called Motorola and they told me it was guaranteed for a year and to send it back to them. The model I bought is no longer sold and they have a new one out now. They told me they will replace the blue tooth. It has been over 3 weeks since I mailed it in and I have yet to hear anything. I am happy with the blue tooth technology. But I am not happy with Motorola. They have never contacted me since I called them about the prolems I was having and have not even taken the time to e-mail be they received my old one (which I know they have by my shipping receipt I got back). My blue tooth may have been a lemon but Motorola\\'s customer service is not up where it should be. I am still waiting for a replacement to come in. In the meantime I am using the free plug-in type I received when I bought my phone.  My advice is Buy a Bluetooth, just be careful who makes it and check out their customer service. I was very happy with my HS820 for the first 3 weeks. It was comfortable and transmission was good. UNfortunately, it was defective and stopped transmitting.  I am giving it a good rating based on the performance up until it stopped working. It won\\'t work with my phone. After 2 hours, I got it to connect, but it won\\'t answer when I get calls or turn on when I want to make them. Plus there were obvious scuff marks on the device. It\\'s made of cheap plastic and the charger has the old-fashioned two-prong adaptor. I\\'m going to start looking for a better device ... especially one that charges with the universal USB adaptor so I don\\'t have to carry multiple cords with me. I just love this bluetooth headset. It was so easy to pair up with my new Sidekick 3. I did not have to do anything except charge the headset and then turn it on. Thanks again Amazon.com for providing me another great product at such a great price. The sound quality is outstanding. People on the other end just know that I am talking on a landline phone until I tell them that I am on a Bluetooth wireless headset and they are astounded. I highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for a brilliant headset at an excellent price. The Motorola HS 820 is the bomb!!! It\\'s a great deal, so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I\\'ve so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar, wish i could return that! But this headset, thinking it\\'s from motorola would work well with my phone, but no. It\\'s on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that\\'s strange. It\\'s also surprising that this happens randomly, so it\\'s kinda annoying, b/c you can\\'t anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird, b/c it shouldn\\'t do that. especially when driving. This was my first foray into the BT department. I first had this paired to a Moto v551 then later to a RAZR v3 Silver and Black. The only shortcoming I can find is the method used to turn the unit on and off. There are times you think you have the headset turned off, but in reality you just redialed the last person called. The HS850 is a better designe here, but thats the only \"one up\" the 850 has on this headset. The volume and fitment of this 820 are much better than on the 850. I have only had 1 signal related issue and that was due to me being too far away from the phone. Overall a great buy! a couple problems with this headset, when using it with the Treo 650 -1. it does not automatically connect when a call is received or initiated2. the volume is way too lowcheck out the Jabra JX10, Cardo Scala, or Palm Treo headset ---- there are too many great headsets out there, to settle for this onehappy shopping! I have to think that some of the other reviewers have older phones, and therefore problems with the unit. It\\'s my first bluetooth headset, but I couldn\\'t be happier.P.S. People dissin\\' it because it doesn\\'t work 25 feet from the phone or because it doesn\\'t stay on your head when jogging? I guess I\\'m not as adventurous with my cell phone as some others... Bought one then a second one, I\\'m impressed, my phone is by the same vendor and I think it is... the worst phone I\\'ve ever had, but  this headset is comfortable and works with my phone and my wife\\'s LG faultlessly.Be aware that there is no mute button, you\\'ll have to use the phone for that.Lasted 1/2 of a year now junk, will no longer hold a charge I am not impressed.I don\\'t know what the other reviewers are smoking. This device does not cancel out background noise. Listeners on the other end say I sound like I\\'m in a tunnel. Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one\\'s mouth and the \"pinhole\" for the internal microphone. There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise. This is a defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking. The \"ear attachment\" and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic. As a result the fit isn\\'t tight enough. I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing\\'s going to fly off my head into the back seat. It\\'s an extremely annoying distraction that you don\\'t want to have while driving.On the good side, I don\\'t have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use. I\\'ve used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst. The sound quality is low, especially outdoors, and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone. The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one\\'s mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I\\'ve tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I\\'m going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250. I\\'ve used those in the past and found them much better overall, and worth the extra price. I used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and I lost it, so I ordered this since this is much much cheaper than my previous one.Different from the previous peice, this item came in with extremely cheap package and it\\'s sound quality is worse than my previous one. My friends complained about the ECHO and noise sometimes so I suspect if this is actually a refurbed one. Sometimes the manufacturer sell such items for much less with simplized packaging. This is my first BT headset. The main reasons I chose this one were low price, small size/weight, and having seen a couple of people use this at work.Pros:The size/weight is so small as to be unnoticeable. I find the headset very comfortable for extended periods of time. Price-wise, it was the cheapest headset from a reputable brand when I bought it. Battery life is decent, probably 3+ days, although I tend to charge it about every two days. Great for driving or any time you want your hands free but can\\'t use speakerphone.Cons:People whom I call have complained occasionally about the sound quality. Range is not great, sometimes 10 ft causes annoying \"I am about to disconnect\" noise. Because there is only one main button that is used for everything, it is very easy to accidentally activate voice dialing, last-number redial, etc. Initial pairing with the phone was not intuitive at all: who knew you had to keep the button pressed while trying to pair up? Finally, the blinking blue light on you temple makes you look like a robot!Recommendation:This is an OK first/small/cheap BT headset. If you talk a lot on the phone, look for something else. There must be headsets out there that provide better sound quality, longer range, and have more intuitive buttons and controls. The voice reception with this headset was just ok. Sometimes people on the other side had trouble hearing me sometimes especially when driving. I also get a tingling sensation around my ear and a mild ache in the outer part of my ear everytime I use it. It may be something to do with  the design of the head set. Research has never proved any connection between using wireless or bluetooth and the impact on your nerves/brain, and I have to believe them...It\\'s weird though that I get always get a tingling, achy sensation if I use a cell phone continuously for more than an hour but with the bluetooth I get the same sensation in about 20 minutes. So try as I might, I cannot wear it for prolonged periods of time. After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging. I did this as other reviewers had warned against over-charging. However, now the headset just died...after 2 months. I called Motorola and they agreed to replace it. It takes about 10-14 days from the time you send it in to get a new one. I\\'m waiting for the replacement to come back. Who knows how long this one will last! It is not the \"greatest\"  The sounds works fine on most calls.  it is not very good on call overseas.  people don\\'t hear very well.  However, I am mostly satisfied with it. This headset is actually not a bad deal but it is not a great deal either.  The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy, long-term usage.  It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog.  I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn\\'t get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn\\'t go up very high).  It\\'s one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven\\'t found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don\\'t find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife\\'s Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.  When I compared the two chargers, they were identical. Excellent sound quality and easy to pair. Looked just as the ad said and the shipping was right on the money. I\\'m using mine with the Jabra A210 non-bluetooth phone adapter and it works fine. I\\'ve used it in the office on my cellphone (handsfree allows me to type and talk with no wires) I use it in the car and it gives me great movement without wires. Very small clips around the ear and you don\\'t even realize its there. Very pleased with this unit. I charge it overnight and it works all day from 530am till 11pm constantly receiving calls. I\\'ve had this for a about a week and I\\'ll leave it on this weekend to see just how long it will last before running out of gas. I\\'m pleased with the quality of the Microphone and Earpiece. Can\\'t believe just how well the mic works. I can shout and whisper and the volume is constant. This is my first bluetooth earpiece and I\\'m happy with it ! Some calls have slight distortion, but since other calls are crystal clear, I have to believe its the cellphone connection and not the earpiece. This headset works fine. It fits perfectly over the ear. Volume isgreat! connects quickly. No echooo. Maybe all the nay sayers need abetter cell phone. I\\'ve tried three bluetooth devices and the HS820 isfar superior to the rest. I bought this headset for probably the same reason most people did, the price. For 30 bucks and from a reliable company you can\\'t go wrong. I got what I paid for. The sound quality and the mic quality are both decent, enough at least for someone who isn\\'t obsessive about how crystal clear the reception is. It has a tendency to drop the connection sometimes for no apparent reason, annoying at times, but not very common.About a month after use, it stopped working for no explicit reason. I sent it back and got a replacement from Motorola. However only a month or so after that, I seemed to have misplaced it, and had pretty much thought it was lost.Today, about a month and a half later, I found it, in my dryer. Apparently it had been in the pocket of one of my jeans that I hadn\\'t washed for a while and it went through a whole wash and dry cycle. Happy that I found it, but I all but gave up on it to work again. I gave it a shot anyway, and lo and behold, it did start charging. So after an hour I tried pairing it with my phone, and voila, IT STILL WORKS! I was stunned. Not only that a bluetooth headset could go through that abuse and still function like new, but a headset that seems relatively cheap and outdated!So based on my first experience it was a 2, but any piece of electronic equipment that can survive a wash and dry HAS to get two more stars in my book. Reliable, and saved me from shelling out more money for a more expensive replacement. It gets the job done. and i\\'m fairly disappointed! i bought this little gem at a cingular kiosk in the mall for $80 and i am thinking it\\'s going back before my 30 days are up! in summary, considering bluetooth still has some improvements to make, this is just NOT worth $80, period. even if this device worked flawlessly, it might be worth about $30 at best.here are my gripes:* it says it has a range of about 30 feet. hmmm...not really. i am even using this headset with a motorola phone (V505)and i can get about 20 feet away from it at best before the audio quality goes south. not the biggest deal in the world. even when i am close to the phone however, there can be some interferance (\"crackling\") and distortion. usually mild though. it seems like my microwave interferes with it (when it\\'s cooking)!* doesn\\'t fit snugly on my ear. rather, it kind of \"hangs\" there. it doesn\\'t have any kind of mechanism for adjustment, so here\\'s hoping it fits your ear. using this headset while lying down is hard to do; the device doesn\\'t seem to want to stay put.* drops the bluetooth connection every now and again, even when i am at close range.the \"good\":* looks cool! ;)* battery life seems to be pretty good.* small, lightweighti am going to look into some other options. this simply was a waste of money. Since there is no rubber to \"gasket\" your ear, noisy environments can make it hard to hear. i.e. in you car. I always thought it was obnoxious to leave your headset on all the time, but now i know why people do it. One you forget you have it on and two it\\'s kind of a pain in the neck to setup. This particular product is pretty good, it pairs up well with my RAZR after saying yes to no less than three questions and works very well. The only complaint I have is it could be louder, but it serves my purpose. The audio is very soft of this headset.  I have to use one hand to push it against my ear each time I want to use it.  Also, it is always checking to make sure it is still connected to the phone, so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds. I love this headset.  It\\'s light, has good voice quality, louder earpiece volume than the phone itself (Mot V710) and the battery outlasts the phone.  A previous reviewer mentioned having to carry 2 chargers.  Motorola makes a Y adapter so you can charge both your phone and headset from 1 charger.  I think I paid under $10 for it but don\\'t quote me.  I love the headset but when I\\'m in an airport, it picks up the background noise as loudly as my voice.  If it was noise canceling it would have gotten 5 stars.  One last note: My phone doesn\\'t ring when connected to the headset so you must have the headset on to know you have an incoming call.  This is a complaint about the phone though not the headset.Update 03-05-2005I just bought an HS-810 because I keep getting complaints of background noise being louder than my voice.  I like it better but the 820 does have better incoming sound quality.  But all in all, I like the 810 much better.  The flip open design is especially nice.  Search for the HS810 to see my complete review.Update 07-21-2005My Motorola V710 went in the dunk a few months ago so I had to buy a new one.  The new software allows the phone to ring even when the headset is connected.  Much better. I got this as a Christmas present for my brother and he absoultely loves it. When talking to him it sounds very clear and there is no static. It is a much better than my Jabra headset which cost nearly twice the price. I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised.  I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume.  Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise.  I found it only adequate in a quiet room.  I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal.  I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car.  It is fine if your sitting in quiet room. This thing just doesn\\'t work well with the Treo 6501. it doesn\\'t automatically connect, when a call comes, or when a call is initiated2. the volume is way too lowthe comfort is good, but for the price, there are many BETTER headsets out there ----consider the Cardo Scala, the Jabra JX10, and the Palm Treo headset - those are your best betshappy shopping! Lasted 3 months, lucky I have two(charge one, while using the other), the units last only for about 2-3 hours of use, hardly good for all day jobs.Like the fit though, but These items need to last the day. I am not impressed.I don\\'t know what the other reviewers are smoking.  This device does not cancel out background noise.  Listeners on the other end say I sound like I\\'m in a tunnel.  Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one\\'s mouth and the \"pinhole\" for the internal microphone.  There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise.  This is a design defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking.  The \"ear attachment\" and its hinge is made of flimsy loose plastic.  As a result the fit isn\\'t tight enough.  I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing\\'s going to fly off my head into the back seat.  It\\'s an extremely annoying distraction that you don\\'t want to have while driving.On the good side, I don\\'t have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use. At first, I was a bit leary about buying one of these, because I had heard that they were never loud enough unless you were in a very quiet place. NOT TRUE! I have to say I\\'ve had to turn down the volume on this before! Now, don\\'t take that out of context, but this is a great product. I live in Texas and drive a loud truck, and I\\'ve been able to use this product driving down the road! I would definitely recommend this product. A great purchase for the money. This headset seems to work fine, but the audio quality is nothing to write home about, to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone. They will also hear a lot of background noise. I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset. It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And, you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it\\'s sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires, which feels a bit safer and freer, especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan. Problems I\\'ve got with this unit:1. Too short range; much shorter than stated 10m;2. Lost signal or lost connection with cellphone more frequently than I imagined;3. When I used this headset to call my friends and T-mobile customer reps, they usually complained that they can barely heard my voice. Maybe the voice collected by the headset is too weak! This is a great cable for me !!I love using it in my car.I connect it to my smartphone to listen to my radio app while I am traveling out of town.Once I lose  range of my favorite  radio station I plug it in and  continue listening  to my favorite radio station thru the app. .Great deal ! I bought this to connect walkman type gadgets to my car stereo.  It worked well at first, but the wiring quickly started having problems.  The sound would cut out and I\\'d need to mess with the cable to find a position where the wires inside would be touching correctly again.  After 8 months, the wire is now completely detached from one of the plug ends.  Maybe the heat of my car played a role in the breakdown of the cable, but if that\\'s how you\\'re planning on use it, don\\'t be surprised if it starts shorting out on you too. Don\\'t purchase these if you plan to use in your car. The side walls are too thin and if this lays next to any 12 power source, my Sirus Radio in my case, you\\'ll get the electrical whine as the cars rpm\\'s increase and decrease. You get what you pay for. It does what it\\'s supposed to.  Hook up my cell phone to my car so I can listen to my mp3.  I\\'m not a audio geek/master so I don\\'t know if it\\'s a good decibel or crisp bass or tremble, but songs seems to play well. Received it, plugged it in, didn\\'t work. Tried jostling the cable and plug around, couldn\\'t get it to work. Can\\'t recommend it. I bought one for my dad to use occasionally and tested it for a couple songs and had no issues like others have had, maybe I\\'m not using it as long. It is cheaper feeling than my more expensive ones. I will update this if things change. We bought this item to replace a broken 3.5 mm cable we use to connect our FM modulator to our iPhone 4s.  We needed something with a thin piece of rubber over the plug so that it didn\\'t catch on the after-market case on our iPhones.  this product worked great, and the price was excellent. Bought this as a line-in cable for my in-dash stereo from my cell phone. The cable does not work. I only get sound out of one side of the stereo when it\\'s fully plugged in. In order to hear stereo, i need to hold cable out to before the spring click. Unfortunately this doesn\\'t suit my needs for the car. The price was good and the cable works great. It seems to be well made. There isn\\'t much else to say about this product. This is a basic cable.  It works and it is cheap.  There is not much else you can say about it. The concept of the phone is terrific.  I have to use a 2-way pager for work, and instead of carting around a cell phone and bulky pager, I now just have this one small item.  And while I didn\\'t think I\\'d really use it, the Bluetooth functionality has definitely sold me.  I can use it not only for a wireless headset, but to connect to the internet and to transfer sound files back and forth as well.The software of the phone seems to be a bit buggy still, unfortunately.  When I lock the keypad, I still sometimes hear tones when the keypad is pressed and the display lights up.  The menus are sometimes slow to respond, delaying as much as 2 full seconds (doesn\\'t sound like much, but it can be irritating).Overall, I\\'d buy the phone again without hesitation, but I\\'m an early adopter.  If you\\'re willing to put up with the occassional buggy behavior, I\\'d definitely recommend this phone. If you have large hands ( like me ) you will find the keyboard difficult to use. I had particular difficulty with the 5-way directional button. No matter how carefully I used the button I ended up hitting the adjacent buttons too. I also had problems using the camera feature because of it\\'s tiny size. However, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a bit of a klutz. I was also displeased to find that the unit\\'s limited memory made any real web browsing impossible. Also, there appears to be no Bluetooth compatibility with Macs. It will sync with the use of a data cable ( a separate purchase required ), but I think it\\'s a shame to spend the extra bucks for Bluetooth only to find it is of limited use.What made me decide to return the phone was that I found the signal to be weaker than any other cell I have ever owned. We live in a little valley that compromises the signal of any cell phone, but the A630 couldn\\'t establish a solid connection.It\\'s a great looking device and it feels very well built. The screen is small, though it provides a very sharp image. I strongly expect that a more nimble fingered PC user might find the phone\\'s many features to be tons of fun. The A630 is another ground-breaking handset design from Motorola.  It showcases the ingenuity of American engineering when you see the QWERTY keyboard hidden underneath on this lightweight (4 oz.) cell phone.  It\\'s stylish, too, and has great reception -- that is, where T-Mobile has coverage at all.  Compared to the Sidekick II and many other T-Mobile phones, the A630 has the best signal-keeping capability, but T-Mobile just sucks big time, unless you live right next to one of their sporadic cell towers.  Worse, their GPRS (data) network is slow and congested.  While surfing the web on the A630 is really cool when the network is accessible, for most part of the day the network is slow and often inaccessible.  We really need the govt to step in and mandate that these cell companies upgrade their networks first before charging consumers an arm and a leg for data services. it\\'s the worst cell phone I had to date.1 this phone has 1 to 2 second delay when buttons are pressed.2 because of slow button key I kept doing and unding key lock/unlock several times to actually call anyone.3. battery life is only about 48hrs (standby) and defintly not 200 some minutes as what this phone\\'s spec says.4. phonebook is pretty messedup. phone book name displys only first half of first line, although it allows you to enter two lines.5. on/off button some times takes second try.6. it\\'s not straight forward to save work/home/mobile... under one name.7. phone charger connection is so flimsy that in certain position it won\\'t charge. design is pretty messed up.8. 1/8\" of color lcd screen is already dying only after 5 month of useage.9. signal is very poor. I\\'m sure this lot more to do with Tmobile.Basically slow and unintuitive phone.Bright side of all this is that Tmobile contact is only for one year. Wife loved it as the \"Razr\" thin phone craze took over. Flip phone with keypad was nice. Used it 2 years with 0 problems. This phone is good for the price, but if you really want a good mobile email solution, get a Sidekick II.Positive:The A630 has good sound quality, and absolutely fantastic sound quality if you use a bluetooth headset. T-Zones service is an inexpensive way to gain access to your POP3 email accounts. It has a keyboard. You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection (I did this using my Mac).Negative:The built-in email software is very poorly designed. It is sloooo[...] It requires way too many key clicks to accomplish common tasks. The most common email commands are buried in the menus, the least common commands occupy the prime spots. Someone didn\\'t think about this enough. It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that\\'s too much. They don\\'t take advantage of the keyboard enough: The keyboard has a Delete key, but you can\\'t use it to delete a message. That\\'s a waste. Likewise, you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller, like in Outlook? To issue a command, you have to use the menu and arrow keys. They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses. (My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature)The case is pretty, but because it\\'s perfectly symmetrical, you can\\'t tell which end is up by feel alone. The keyboard is so slick that you can\\'t dial by feel either -- you need to look. These are safety issues. (but if you have a headset, you can dial by voice)So far, the battery doesn\\'t last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth, and who primarily talk or text, and who use POP3 occasionally, or not at all. Pros:1. Compact in Size;2. eye-ball-absorber design;3. Good bluetooth connection (w/ HS820 headset);4. Convinient input keyboard;5. The screen is clear enough to show a vivid picture;Cons:1. battery is toooooo weak. A full charged battery can only last for one day (with normal amount of incoming and outgoing calls and without any other devices connected). A lot shorter than they claimed in the description (6 days in waiting mode)!2. A little bulky compared tp other camera phones(like samsung);3. The phonebook is a little different from all the other brands;4. System freezed up once when I input phone numbers with bluetooth device connected. I have to reset it by taking the battery out;5. No zoom function with the build-in camera; Can\\'t observe the picture from front small screen when taking photos with the phone closed;6. No software; Just one Java game come with the unit. No choiceother than purchasing more on line. great product at a great price I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s. I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae&#8217;s which needed to be pulled out of the phone.  Since the phone antennae&#8217;s have changed, I haven&#8217;t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them. I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth. The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters. This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone, I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength. I guess that\\'s the reason why they\\'re selling so cheap. Do not waste your time with this product. Forgot I had this on my phone until I got the request to review it. But, my phone has been working exceptionally well lately...because of these boosters!! I have a Blackberry Torch. You just put this sticky little piece of film by your battery and *viola* you have way better reception!! Seems to do the trick. Recommend!! And it\\'s a great price to boost your phone\\'s antenna. Didn\\'t work for my Galaxy S3 SPH-L710 so in case you have this same phone or just a Galaxy S3 (Verison, AT&T, T-Mobile) doesn\\'t matter. It wont work. This does not work at all. And once you put it on it is so hard to took off. Never again!!!! I PUT THIS PRODUCT IN MY PHONE AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SIGNAL STRENGTH AT ALL. I BOUGHT SOME BEFORE AND THEY ACTUALLY HELPED BUT THESE DID NOT. So far it\\'s working as intended. I\\'m satisfied and the price is right. Easy instruction of how to install the booster inside your cell phone. I do get reception, but it added a bar for me.  These are no \\'Magic Bullet\\' for bad reception, but they can take it \\'just over the edge\\'.I have used these before in old phones, but they get \\'lost\\' easily if I forget to remove them when changing batteries.  So this is good enough to \\'re-purchase\\', at least for me. It gives more bars then had before. Such a perfect item. Made my bf very happy as well. So perfect of an item. these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try. but really not worth a dime you do not get a 6 pack you only get 1 of them do not be fooled i was very upset that it only came with one and i do not liked to be tricked like that We\\'ve had the Sidekick II for about two months.  Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn\\'t have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to \"press 1 for English\", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter \"A\" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can\\'t take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it\\'s trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can\\'t use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper, it isn\\'t really ready for prime time. First, let me just say to those who bash this phove because of T-Mobile, STOP!  You are here to review the phone, not the service.  How is it phone\\'s fault?  It\\'s your service and shouldn\\'t be phone\\'s fault.Pros/Features:Qwerty Keyboard makes it easy to send text messagesWeb BrowserAOL Instant MessangerYahoo MessengerEmail at your fingertipsCamera Phone with Room for up to 36 photosOrganizer/Calender/CalculatorNifty Design reminds you of a mini-laptopCons:Bulky:  Looks like a mini-laptop but won\\'t fir easily in your pocket...Case/Belt Clip is a MUSTButton Size:  Could be small for those with big fingersWeb Browser:  Slow, but beacause the sites could be cached, it gets a tad faster.  Don\\'t expect cable speed!  This is more of 28.8 speed.No background wallpaper: Because of the deaktop icons, background image isn\\'t availableOverall...Positive Outweigh the tiny Negatives by a ton.  If you are an internet.IM junkie, you will fall in love with this phone.  The reception in my area is fine.  However, the reception varies from area to area. Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing, web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go.  You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it\\'s uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile\\'s GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it\\'s even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you\\'ll probably find T-Mobile\\'s abysmal coverage tolerable and SK\\'s true wireless Internet access appealing. I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice. However, it\\'s kinda huge compared to a regular cellphone, and I found that to be a bit of a drag. My service agreement seemed kind of pricey,  and the coverage was poor (I couldn\\'t get a signal in my own kitchen, and I live in the middle of a big city, not out in the country) and in the end, I\\'ve shelved this phone for a smaller one with a cheaper monthly fee. I started out with the sidekick color switched for a short time to the Blackberry 7100t and then came back to the sidekick II. I So love this phone. There is no other phone on the market that compares in many areas.Pro\\'s -Super easy to use.Best messaging out therebest screen out therecrazy good data servicegood downloads for ringtones, games and appsGreat signal (I was in rural Kentucky and still got a signal)Very reliableBest Data/Voice plan with T-mobile -- I have been with T-mobile for 5 years or so and have tried other services during that time. No other service has provided any better phone, signal, or features for a lower or even a competitive price.Con\\'sIn order for service to remain good you have to periodically reset the phone. Dont know why, but when I do that it fixes any reception problems. T-Mobile techs said this was a good idea.That\\'s it everything else is normal and great about this phone.Unless you need corporate email dont bother with the blackberry. It was the worst phone I have ever used. I\\'ve had my SKII fo a little over a month now and find it a good fit for my needs.  I am a business user, not a Snoop Dog groupie, and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin, TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor, I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.  I don\\'t find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger\\'s servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that\\'s a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are \"OK\" but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger\\'s website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates. Worth a year\\'s contract with TMO in my book.  Paying $49/mo for 3000 regional anytime minuets and $20/mo for all you can eat data (email, text messaging, etc, etc EVERYTHING DATA included).I would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service.  Not the smallest/best coolest phone, but the best convergent communication device on the market right now IMHO. Pro\\'s:Very easy to use.Qwerty keyboardOTA (Over The Air) software upgrades that add usability to it once or twice a year.Full buddy list loading for AIM and YIM.Synchs to both Windows and Mac computers.Large clear screen.Allow for export of web bookmarks.Use up to three Pop3 or Imap4 email addresses with it.Con\\'sNo external memory.limited camera memory.no Bluetooth.no spell checker for the emailNo Microsoft Exchange email support so no corporate email unless it is a Pop3 or allows you to login from the web.Overall an excellent device. I give it five stars - despite some technical problems:You can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you can\\'t always file them when you receive them. They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution\\'s vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard\\'s formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can\\'t click on them. You can\\'t click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, \"With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?\" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can\\'t browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft\\'s sms generation site).  So you can\\'t browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn\\'t work.I\\'ve resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called \"screen\" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, \"[IMAGE]\", the button completely goes away, which means that you can\\'t access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don\\'t work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile\\'s hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps. The Sidekick 2 has a better form factor than the competitors such as Treo 600/610 and Blackberry offerings. It has a better more comfortable keyboard. It\\'s more like a mini computer than a phone, which I like. It can fully multitask, unlike Palm. You can download a webpage, check email and chat on AIM all at the same time, unlike  on the Palm, which will interrupt the process if you leave the application. Further, the Sidekick II has both AIM and Yahoo! Messenger.I like the built in camera and I find I don\\'t miss having a Palm at all especially now that you can use Intellisync with the Sidekick 2 to sync all your contact/calendar information with your desktop computer. I never really liked stylus input on the Palm anyway and again the keyboard on the Sidekick is a lot better. The Blackberry units are nice however I still find the Sidekick more cool, easier to use and it has better instant messaging capabilities.My only slight complaint is that the Sidekick 2 does not have a replaceble battery. I would much prefer to be able to swap out the battery. I have used a lot of screen protectors for my iphone, and this one is the best. I\\'m happy to finally have a clear screen cover that works. For the past two years I wouldn\\'t even try them, using only the anti-glare covers. Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there (wasn\\'t the case with previous clear covers I had used). Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between. And finally, finger prints do not show up as readily as they do when there is no cover.Nice screen cover. Highly recommended. The order was delivered on time and the clear touch is nice fit for my Galaxy S4. I ordered the anti glare version and it is easy to apply w/o any air bubbles. The protector works nice on the sun light. Also no finger prints or marks visible. Would definitely recommencement. Absolutely love this screen protector. It came on time and the product was just as expected. I love how it comes equipped with everything you need to install it. A wetnap, dry nap, cleaning cloth, and the flattening clip you use to even out the protector once its on. It looked very professional and my Galaxy S4 Screen looks SUPER vibrant and clean. You can not even tell that theres a screen protector. I would recommend this screen protector to anyone because the value surpasses the price. Afforable and efficient. I\\'ve been a loyal BoxWave customer for years. The quality, price, value, and dust free installation are unbeatable. These shields do a great job at protecting ALL of my electronics and also hold up well to scratches so that I don\\'t need to even replace them. Could not be happier. Just recived my screen protectors and there amazing. They came packaged very well. They come with a very thivk cleaning cloth and some wet and dry cleaning wipes. Once I put on protector on it was really clear no problems at all great feeling to the protector it was cut really well. Will defenetly buy more when I need them wont be using another protector but boxwave.. very satisfied (: Oh my, crystal clear... stands up to its name. ..absolutely easy directions to follow... No lint. . my screen looks like it has no protector on it. I am very careful with my device, so I do not know how it will handle items scratching the screen or fingerprints..I received it quickly, and I didn\\'t have to pay for shipping, plus because I bought one item, received this packet for free. It comes with two screen protectors. If you follow the directions, you should not need the other. I have purchased others, and followed the directions and still end up with lint underneath... YES, I would recommend this item. ..It is a must have for your phone. .. I\\'m a lover of all gadgets and always have to get the \"coolest\" cell phone out there at the time.  This phone has been really great over the past 14+ months that I\\'ve owned it (I have the blue version).  I\\'ve not had ONE problem with it doing anything it shouldn\\'t do (i.e. randomly powering off, antenna problems, etc).  I cannot say that for every cell phone I\\'ve ever owned.  LG makes a great cell phone and within their different models, I think this one is the best I\\'ve seen so far.  My brother has this exact model and loves it, too.The phone has a beautiful color screen, easy to navigate menus, a nice camera and video function, and OUTSTANDING battery life.  The only complaint I will echo is that it would be nice at times to have a speakerphone.  Other than that, this cell phone is the best I\\'ve found - including several other LG models that friends and family own. I had it over 3 years and it was working great. Battery lasts very long. Phone is very durable and solid. I regret buying this phone, it\\'s really big, and verizon service isn\\'t that great with this phone.  For some reason other verizon phones have like 3 bars when mine has 1, or will have 1 bar when i\\'m getting no service.  That said, the phone does have a beautiful inner LCD, the outer LCD is pretty bad.  You can play with the settings. It has loads of features like alarms and calanders and everything else you could think of.  The camera is terrible, which is pretty much true with all cell phones though, so that\\'s a non unique gripe. The phone is also moderately fruity, like when you make or recieve calls, the outer LED will start blinking purple, blue, pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl, and the menus are all kind of childish.  That said, when the phone does have some bars, calls never drop and it\\'s pretty easy to set up the phone.  I\\'m not sure what other options there are out there for verizon cell phones, i recently switched from tmobile, but im sure you can do better than this phone, good luck. i like camera phones, but i can\\'t believe this phone don\\'t have usb cable to upload pics..i have to pay $.25 for sending each pics..Viewing all camera phones, this one is pretty nice..It\\'s got flash, and it\\'s got 4 different types of resolutions..It zooms in more than i expected..Other than camera, for contact list, it gives you to save #s, pic, ringtones for a person..I think thats good..i guess that\\'s all i\\'m gonna say..Overall, phone is decent.For other viewers, if you wanna buy this, you should buy it now, and don\\'t wait cause more updated phones will come out soon Ok, so I used to have a Motorola T720 (one of the worst phones made), and a Motorola Timeport 8767 (One of the best phones ever made).  I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don\\'t need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It\\'s pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 \"real\" pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few \"doodle type\" cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon\\'s Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3\\'s as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the \"hinge\" of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I\\'d never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it\\'s fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won\\'t probably guess you\\'re video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you, the old \"blue versions\" of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new \"black face\" ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led\\'s near the \"flash\" when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don\\'t.I like the phone and it\\'s size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said, \"that thing is huge!\"..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.  This is one of Verizon\\'s best cell phones right now...highly recommended. Guys,I have used several of my friends bluetooth headsets (motorolas and jabras) and had decided I didn\\'t want one.  Then I found the Mobile Freedom and read the reviews.  I know Logitech and have used a lot of their stuff with good results so I tried it.  IT DOES EVERYTHING YOU HAVE READ!!  It\\'s quiet in the wind, it\\'s battery lasts for days for me, it\\'s easy to use, easy to pair and the sound quality is awesome!!  Nobody could ever tell I was using a headset.  It takes a bit to get used to the ear clip, but once you do there are no problems.  It may be a bit heavier and larger than some, but then those little tiny ones that look so chic also have TERRIBLE reviews and TERRIBLE performance!!  Try it out, you won\\'t regret it. I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away. It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven\\'t done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets, I can\\'t say if it is the headset or the phone, but either way, if you buy one of these and have the same problem, make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly, there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out, which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well, but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent. I\\'ve asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I\\'m talking to them with the headset, and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck! I bought the Logitech after reading numerous reviews on various brands.  I use the device with a Motorola V551 phone (Cingular).  It works geat!  It charges very quickly and the charger folds up in a compact fashion when not in use (the electrical prongs fold up into a recess in the charger). The unit holds a charge for a long time.  I left it in a drawer for a month, pulled it out and it was still ready to go!I use the device a couple of times a month on business, when driving, etc.  The windscreen is outstanding and cuts out noise even when driving with the window open.  some people complain about the ear piece.  It seems fine to me and you can adjust it easily, but keep in mind any headset is an annoyance when you first wear one.  Then it becomes second nature.the sound is great, the phone detects the device quickly, its fairly comfortable. All it all it performs just like a device twice its price, I have a Motorola Razr phone and I absolutely hate it because it has low hearing volume and bad reception resulting in missed calls.  I was seriously planning on returning/selling it until I got this Freedom headset!It makes a huge difference!  Very lightweight and comfortable!  No problems with range or battery life.  A little bulky though.  Just got it the other day and a must buy, especially at $40 with $10 rebate = $30!! Its the only bluetooth headset I\\'ve used, so I don\\'t have anything to compare it with.  Has made my ipaq 6315 much more usable as a phone.  Sound quality is good, some people say I sound far away, I\\'m experimenting with the gain on the ipaq, we\\'ll see if that helps.  It was a little tight for me at first (big ears), I was able to bend the part that goes around the ear a little and its much better now.  Great battery life.Would be nice to have an external ringer on it, so I could hear it ringing or vibrate if I were away from the phone.  Good range 15-30\\'. i had bought the motorola HS820 before this one for $80. i have a motorola V505 from at&t.; the motorola worked pretty well, but i thought $80 for a bluetooth headset was way too much. i returned the motorola and picked up the logitech instead and for 1/2 the cost, i was just as happy.it fits a little awkwardly on my ear, but so did the motorola, so i am thinking my ears are the problem. call clarity and voice recognition is good. battery life is good. weight on ear is good. overall, i am pretty impressed!i wish there was some way to adjust the tightness of the earpiece as it feels kind of loose on my ear. would also be nice if the \"on\" button wasn\\'t so small that you covered it up with your finger when you turned it on, making it hard to see the flashing blue light.whenever i use my microwave, it makes the bluetooth connection drop. just warning ya\\'. ;) I\\'ve been using this headset for a few months and couldn\\'t be more pleased with the battery life. It recently had no problems keeping up with a four hour Skype session!It is also capable of pairing with multiple devices, so you can for instance use it with your computer at home and your cell phone on the road without having to redo the pairing every time, something cheap brand-X headsets don\\'t do.Logitech was kind enough to supply a very tiny charger, perfect if you take your headset on the road. For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it\\'s possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you\\'re not careful. Of course the battery won\\'t charge up and the light won\\'t go on, a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset, but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity, it goes to low-power mode \"sleep\". When the phone it is paired with rings, it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing, you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away, you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset, but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don\\'t forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there. If you can live with the looks, it\\'s a super deal. the \"behind the ear\" thing just broke...I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly, and this piece of junk just fell apart!!!Very dissapointed!!!I should have made my additions to this review long ago, but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way! They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset, but not just a replacement, an $85 replacement! Then told me to keep the broken one, which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue!Really incredible customer support...I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name!BTW, 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue. I\\'m a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitz,bells and whistles, and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price.  But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced, as well.  I could not get a comfortable fit.  My ear is well within normal range of size and shape, but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive, wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don\\'t care about medium to long term fit and comfort, or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear, you may be happy with this headset.  I wasn\\'t, and am returning it.  I\\'m going to give the Cardo Scala a try;  if it\\'s no good, I\\'ll probably go with a Jabra, and spend a bit more money. I\\'ve had this for about a year.  It works great.  Great call quality, no static.  Battery life is real good.  The only bad part is this looks like a part of a males anatomy and I don\\'t really want that on my head.  Otherwise great buy. Let me say a few things:Buy THIS device.  Here are the reasons:- 7-8 Hours talk time- True 30 feet range- Wind filter for clear talking- Small and comfortable, doesn\\'t intrude your ear- Crazy price, huge quality- Warranty and reliability of Logitech!I\\'ve used a Sony Ericsson and Jabra BT200 and I would say the Jabra is much better than Sony Ericsson, but the Logitech blows them both away.  It\\'s faster to put on the Logitech and the range is much better.  The microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient.For me, I used a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter for a Sprint Sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack.  It gave me BT on my phone so I could use this headset.  The auto-answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not.  Works great for me!If you are considering a headset, get this one.  It\\'s what bluetooth technology should be like.  It\\'s so great that Amazon sold out...  nice.  It was $39.99 (where did they all go???) I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price and read some reviews but I thought hey its Logitech it must be good.  I was right this headset is very comfortable compared to another headset I just bought.  The ear speaker is loud even to the point that I don\\'t have to have it on the highest setting.  The mic was the thing I was worried about though, so I called my friend\\'s cell phone and talked to myself and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound volume and clarity.  Also I haven\\'t had any complaints from other friends I\\'ve talked to with the headset.  It has been my experience that Logitech makes the best wireless devices for the buck and they didn\\'t let me down with this one (second Logitech wireless devices in two month; I also bought their xbox controller which is definitely also worth the buy.) The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn\\'t broken.  Even wind didn\\'t seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can\\'t be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn\\'t want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I\\'ve been using for months and I\\'m very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn\\'t measure up to the Logitech. I have used it now for 2 weeks with a RAZR V3 and I am satisfied it works as advertised. It was very easy to pair the headset with the phone. The sound is good even in noisy environments. The headset is light, confortable and fits well.My only complaint is about the smart button used to turn on/off, answer, dial and pair. The button is also a LED indicator. The LED flashes diferently (different colors, intervals) for various modes but it is difficult to see the LED while pushing and holding the button. After a few days I got used to it and now I know how long to hold the button down to switch on/off, pair or use voice dial.At $42 it is a good deal. very cheap excellent value. the problem with most is their uselessness when confronted by windy conditions- this does a much better job than most. v simple instructinos, though it lacks the ability to switch easily between headset & phone & back.nevertheless at $35 or under, brilliant value. Pros:- Price- Ease of pairing- Sound quality (yours and theirs)- Battery lifeCons- Painful for an extended time (10 mins)- Hard to tell if on or off I bought the Logitech Mobile Freedom Headset (980228-0403) for use with VoIP on my HP zt3000 Windows XP SP2 notebook. I wanted to use a wireless headset and VoIP to make international calls, mostly from hotel rooms. This headset did not work out of the box for my situation. The Logitech support website was great. It said to upgrade the notebook\\'s bluetooth software. The HP site was also excellent. I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers. Once installed, the headset immediately worked as docuemented. The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I\\'ve been experiencing too. I\\'m using Skype for VoIP service. Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only, otherwise the normal audio devices are used. All in all, installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported. I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom. Due to my usage, I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones. The device apparently will not work with the majority of PocketPCs due to a lack of bluetooth software. Thus I only gave it 4 stars. However, HP does sell stereo headphones (no microphone) for most IPaq models.Update: 15-March-2005 Am able to pair with Axim x50v PocketPc. Has considerable static. Skype and other apps nearly unusable. Continues to work with XP well. Suggest Plantronics MX100I Stereo Headset for using Skype on a PPC. Got this headset to replace my Jabra (which was incompatable with my Nokia 3650). Fit and comfort is extremely subjective but I found the Jabra to be far more comfortable (I would actually forget I was wearing it); that said, this unit is not uncomfortable (until after a couple hours) just not nearly AS comfortable or securely fitting.Very few complaints as far as performance. It was easy to pair with my phone, my wife\\'s Motorola V3 and even my laptop. Sound quality is clear for both parties (recipients occasionally complained of a pinging noise with the Jabra) and the noise reduction actually works to eliminate wind noise. Battery life is excellent. The single function can be a little aggrevating (especially when trying to turn it off as you have to hold it down for a long time). The only weird and very rare quirk is occassionally calls will be interrupted with a strange sound that sounds like someone dropping a manhole cover as it spins on pavement - very strange, very annoying and fortunately very rare.Overall, performance is top notch, comfort is acceptable and value is difficult to beat. I have been using this for a month.PROS:It is a good value.  It works really well, and it lasts a very long time on a charge.  The WindStop feature works very well.  People have been able to hear me very well while driving and even while playing volleyball.  It stays on the ear well but is not uncomfortable.CONS:The unit looks okay but is less attractive than some of the other high-tech units on the market.  3 of my co-workers have commented that it looks like I am wearing a phallic symbol on my ear, which is really not the look I would like to achieve. Because I spent a lot of time on the phone, I am very particular about BT headsets.  I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine, I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don\\'t understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to \"get off your crappy Jabra BT headset\" or \"take me off your Motorola BT headset\".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it\\'s a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it\\'s really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a \"correct\" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can\\'t speak for all, but I personally don\\'t wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it\\'s behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.  I am sure customers that raved about Jabra would rank this unit out of this world! Good reception. It fits OK on my ear but not perfectly. It seems sturdy. Price was better than most. The wind doesn\\'t bother it much either. We bought the Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter to go with ourPlantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headsetand have been very pleased with both devices. Using the handset lifter give you the ability to answer calls directly from the wireless headset, which is good if you spend a lot of time away from the physical phone to which the headset unit is connected.Setup was amazingly easy, just following the directions allowed us to get this installed in just a few minutes on our very inexpensive no-name speaker phone.Like our Plantronics Headset, this has passed the test of time and I would buy a new one if it failed today.Highly Recommended!CFH This device allows me to answer incoming calls on my NEC phone while I roam the office with my Plantronics wireless headset in place. This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building, so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations. A couple of key features:When a call comes in, either Intercom or from an external line, there is a chime in my ear that alerts me to the call. I can then press the single button on the headset and the receiver is lifted, allowing me to receive the call.When the call is done, I press the single button again and the receiver hangs up.It\\'s about as simple as conceivably possible.The install instructions were however less than perfect. To get this to work properly, I have to unplug the phone base from the handset and in to the Plantronics unit. The handset is then plugged in to the Plantronics unit. This was not explicitly stated in the install instructions. It took 10-15 minutes to figure out the trick. Once that was worked out however, everything has been perfect.The only thing that I cannot easily do is pick up parked calls as there is no function to select a line. I can live with that shortcoming. First of all, I must start out by saying that I am a little surprised that this little mechanical device is even necessary with all of the technological advances out there these days.  The HL-10 is kind of a \"throw back to the seventies\" in terms of its jerry rigging function.  Having said this...  Plantronics builds quality stuff and I am sure that there is a good reason for it.  The device does exactly what it is supposed to do once you adjust it for your individual phone.  I was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup.  I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N  headset - which I love for it professional wireless function.  I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time.  That was good enough for me.  Definitely worth the $ if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the house/office while talking on the phone. There isn\\'t much to say here.  For the phone system I have, this was needed to enable the remote functions of the  Plantronics-CS540 Convertible Wireless Headset.  It could be more aesthetically-pleasing, but as I\\'m sure it\\'s designed for a wide variety of phones that need a remote lifter, I suppose you can\\'t complain.Mounting the unit can be tricky.  You need to be certain it will work properly before you use the sticky tape to mount it in place.  So, you wind up holding it with one hand while working your headset to activate/deactivate it several times to be sure you\\'ve found the right spot for it.Comes with a special headset adapter for phones with shapes that offset the lifter bar. I used this phone lifter in combination with the Plantronics CS50 Wireless Office Headset.  It was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to 300 feet away from my office. This lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset.  You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing.  The setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone.I spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day.  This is a useful tool in any modern office and I recommend it to you. This device takes a signal from a wireless headset like the CS540 and lifts up the receiver from your base phone unit. Depending on your phone\\'s angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it\\'s angled correctly. That\\'s because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I\\'m going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody\\'s business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn\\'t arrive DOA. That\\'s right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me, plus a week\\'s wait. I put all this stuff in the review, because I\\'m not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We\\'re pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it\\'s not the swiftest design imaginable. The little extender rod/gripper that is your last-ditch method to get your receiver to hang up is a kludge, in my opinion. Perhaps you\\'ve had better results, but I find this thing less than perfect. It looks strange stuck to the side of the phone, but we have an older Starpluss STS system that needs the handset lifted for a wireless headset to work properly.  This item was easy to set up.  It took about 10 minutes to unpack and install. Our office phones lifters stopped working so I decided to take a chance on these lifters instead of having to order a whole new headset and so glad I did.  They work great! This handset lifter is great.  It works exactly as I expected it to. It also arrived when I expected it to. The vender of our phone system wanted to charge us hundreds of dollars for some other mechenism to interface with our wireless headset system.  The Plantronics HL 10 was not only much less expensive, it works flawlessly and was easy to install. HL10 Handset lifter works great, very fast to pick up if away from the phone base!  I would buy again. Works Great, a very useful accessory for any wireless headset and the Amazon price is right compared to what Plantronics wants!!! Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter was what was promised and it was delivered on time. I got this for my boss and he seems to like it. this is a great product, but i order the wrong size and i intend to pass it forward to anyone in need of it.  the purchase price was great.make sure you know the size of that adapter, before making your selection. My wife uses this at work and had been using this for a year and it still works. I normally buy every 3 months because she breaks them. This is the only one that lasted more than 3 months. These were exactly what my mother needed for her old Nokia 2690.  She goes through them quickly, so I got her two. They r a good price and it works a win win situation.  People have no problem hearing me or I them . It says it\\'s compatible with all Motorola handsets...  It doesn\\'t work at all with Motorola/Giant Talkabout FRS/GMRS/CB 2-way radios having 2.5mm jacks.  Very disappointing. bought this for work and it works great. the sound is clear and the microphone is located in a convenient location. the clip is also a great addition to the headset. I bought this for my husband.  He likes it and it works jut fine for him.  He has one in each vehicle he drives I had to teach an on-line WebEx class. Normally I am provided a phone bridge. However, this time, they wanted to utilize VOIP only. I didn\\'t want to use a normal head set with a cord tie\\'n me to within 6 feet of the computer. I needed 8 hours of talk time, I\\'m the instructor. This fit the bill. I let it charge over night and it\\'s ready for the next day. I do put it back in the charger during lunch break. The only reason I didn\\'t give it a 5 star is that my ear hurt at the end of the day. The piece that goes over the head to keep the unit to my ear put to much pressure on my ear. I will have to try the other ear adapters. I could not be more impressed. I was highly skeptical as I have been buying bluetooth headsets like crazy trying to find one that worked, and they\\'re all pretty much junk. This thing worked all the way out to the sidewalk, and likely much further, but that\\'s as far as I went. The quality on the other end is very clear. The manual is plain stupid, it looks like they were half way through putting it together when they released it, but on the Mac the manual was of course not needed, just plug it in and it worked without any of the driver install nonsense Windows requires. BTW, I am using it primarily with Skype.OK, I have to add something to this review. There\\'s a fatal flaw in this device. A flaw that makes the device near worthless to me now. If the USB cable is unplugged, but the earpiece is left clipped into the holder/charger, the battery runs down within hours. Obviously a simple diode somewhere would have prevented this, but for me the device now is close to useless.Update: May 8th 2011. So, 5 years later, the device is seriously failing. the electronics in the device are dying. I am having to constantly remove the battery to get the headset to work, and it\\'s cutting me off in the middle of calls. It also refuses to charge, and discharges when not in use even when the base is connected via USB. It\\'s a pity its failing, and I came looking for a new version, but there is none. Should I just buy it again? This is a usb wireless headset. just plug it in to your mac or pc and it sees it as another sound device , no drivers needed (xp or os x) I tested it with Skype on the mac and teamspeak on my pc . It comes with a sound api for windows for skype and a few others that allow the buttons on the phone to pickup or hangup calls , I did not try it out because I just like to use apps as is without special add ons ...The range is great , so if you skype and dont want to be tied to your pc then plug this bad boy in and your free to walk all over the house , same goes for teamspeak for the gamers out there.It was so pleasing for something to just work out of the box for a change! I tried for hours to do the same thing using bluetooth and it was a mess... This thing just works! Set it up, it worked great for a little over 24 hours and the base unit failed to connect to my laptop. Returned and purchased a different item. Didn\\'t want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing.  Can\\'t afford to be offline for as long as it will take to get this replaced.To be fair, I have used several Plantronics headsets and they were all great... my all time favorite is now 10+ years old and not compatible with Google Voice (though it does work great with Cisco IP phone). I also have a bluetooth Plantronics Voyager headset for my iPhone and it is also very good. I use this product for skype calls.  I found it to be the most high quality (but expensive) wireless headset for VOIP uses. I use it on Windows Vista and Windows 7.  The headset lasts a long time (all day) without charging, and I can go from my computer outside the house and half way down the street and I still have clear calls.  The ear piece is not as comfortable as I\\'d like, but after you wear it a while I think your head adjusts to the shape.Software install was easy, and setup was pretty no-brainer.  It has other functionality and adjustments that I do not use and have not had to learn about.I use this brand also for a regular phone headset on my work phone and absolutely love it.  I\\'ve found very high quality calls and battery life on every Plantronics device I\\'ve ever used. My previous two PalmOS phones were a Kyocera 6035 and a Samsung i500. Had I not needed Bluetooth to work with my new Toyota Prius, I\\'d have stuck with the i500. In fact, if Samsung/Sprint had released the i550 (SD memory slot, faster, etc.) I would have never considered the Treo 650.  So, let\\'s talk about the positives of the 650:Camera w/movies is nice.  Memory card slot is nice.  It\\'s fast. Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync! Handfree in the Prius works great. Having a PalmOS 5 based machine gives a more powerful web browser that can view more sites. Higher rez screen is nice.On the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it\\'s as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I\\'ve been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on \"write on screen\" apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.No voice recognition at all, but for $20 you can get a program that is awesome and doesn\\'t have to be trained.  \"Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2\" and it does.  \"Call Bob Tompson Mobile\" and it matches it to the address book -- no training, beyond numbers. VERY NICE.Battery life is so-so.  You have to charge it each day if you use the \\'net much. i500 was poor, too, but better than this.  The 6035 I could use for almost a week without charging it!  (6035 and i500 had analog modes, too, while the 650 is digital only.)So, it\\'s okay, I\\'m okay with it, it crashes/reboots randomly all the time, but ... there\\'s really no other option on Sprint.I would have taken a flip phone over this huge brick phone in a heartbeat... But there is none, so, with that said, the Treo 650 is okay.  More steps back, a few steps forward, but no other choiuce. I just got the Treo 650 through pre-order the other day after using the Treo 600 for over a year (and 4 replacements ... the 600s just kept breaking). It is a dramatic improvement and I love it.The screen is now high res and looks incredibly clear, the Bluetooth works wonderfully with the wireless Jabra headset. When a call comes in simply hit answer on the phone and the call comes through the headset. I don\\'t particularly like the comfort fit of the Jabra on my ear so I will probably be looking at other alternatives as well.The camera is now actually good enough to take snapshots you would keep. Almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras.  A few of the critical buttons are placed more intuitively.Initial setup went pretty smoothly, so far, it seamlessly upgraded my old Treo 600 software and imported all my contacts and calendar as well as almost all my applications.  The Sprint phone rep that activated my phone actually seemed to be quite knowledgable.The only real CON is that the Treo 650 Hotsync cable connector is big and clunky compared to 600. IMHO they made a backward step by replacing the sleek original Treo connector with the Tungsten design connector. It requires a separate power supply to charge.  I have been used to charging my Treo 600 through the single USB hotsync cable to my laptop.  This extra power connection is a messy annoyance.  The upside is that since the battery is removable I can have a spare charging elsewhere.Overall opinion is that I wouldn\\'t even consider returning to or buying a Treo 600 now that the Treo 650 is available. I am not too picky when it comes to a PDA phone, if I can keep my outlook calendar, appointment, and call the contact store on it, I\\'m happy! But I do wish the Treo 600 can be better!I had the Treo 600 for almost 1 year and upgraded to Treo 650 as soon as PalmOne asked me to that\\'s because Parts of my prayer has been answered: A better screen resolution; touch screen is more sensitive than the 600, I use my finger instead of the stylus now; camera is a lot clearer and the zoom works great; removable battery is really handy to use that fully charged spare one any time; my favorite bluetooth is built-in. And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read. Thanks to the faster processor, the program loads a lot faster.However, I am still looking for the built-in WiFi, and the bluetooth does not take voice command; reboot is not as easy as Treo 600. I do not notice the boot up being slow because I rarely have to. However, I did notice that it takes up more internal memory and thus make the available ram less than 10MB the first time I turned it on. (Palm is doing a flash upgrade to fix this, so I heard.) With an SD card, I put a bunch of application on it to get around this until it get fixed. And I was able to have about 18MB available internally.I like this new Treo 650, as to all my handheld gadgets, I bought a fitted case to protect it. If you like me want to keep everything in perfectly nice looking condition, I recommad a case and a screen protector. Remember, this is a hefty investment comparable to a PC, this Treo 650 may even be your home phone, make sure it is well-protected. I have had this phone almost 6 weeks (40 days).  At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm\\'s responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a \"free return and repair,\" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don\\'t work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don\\'t understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they\\'re doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn\\'t that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon\\'s remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can\\'t figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don\\'t get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?  I know mine tries to; otherwise, we\\'re out of business. I purchased this phone a few months ago and can truly say it is one of the best investments I have ever made! I had doubts on how comfortable I\\'d be lugging around a big phone like this, but that was short lived once it was in my hands. I get so much use from this phone, not only for the phone itself, but for the PDA capabilites. I have never been so organized and on top of things. The only thing is that it sometimes freezes when it connects with my Bluetooth, but it\\'s a minor complaint and one easily overlooked when I look back and see how much this phone has helped me. I\\'ve owned a Palm of some type for about seven years, and had a cell phone for slightly less time.  I\\'ve always resisted buying a combined device, because I thought \"they aren\\'t ready yet.\"  When it came time to replace my PDA, I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready.  I had concerns about the size of the screen, and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions.  Overall, most of my nervousness about it was groundless.  I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points:Works well as a phone--Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable, even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine.  The interface has been redesigned a bit, and you seldom need the stylus.  Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen, or with the keypad.  You truly can do many functions one-handed.  But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm, you aren\\'t having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile--In English, this means that if your batteries go dead, you don\\'t lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points:Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right.  It\\'s not really a problem, but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms, I\\'m not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair.  I am able to get two days out of it with medium use, and have a bit of life left in the battery.  Not like the days of the monochrome Palms when you\\'d go for a week between recharges!It\\'s only so-so as a web browser.The price is hideously high.Keyboard is cramped, but about as good as you can expect on such a small device.  It is definitely useable.  My instinct was to use my right thumb only, but I now believe the people who claim that if you use both hands (thumbs only) you\\'ll be faster.From what I\\'ve seen of the Treo 600, I do not believe the upgrade would be worth it for those who currently own a 600.  If you are waiting to make the jump into a combined PDA/phone, I believe thhis is a good point to do it. I am in love with this phone!First off, the Palm functionality is wonderful! The address book and calendar all work excellently, and the cross-functions are greatImprovements include SMS messaging, which is much faster and now includes hyperlinks for phone numbers and web addresses, unlike the Treo 600The web on here is faster ---- the screen is crisperHowever, BlueTooth is the BEST new feature ----- wireless data transfer is, usually, quick, and the wireless headphones are greatLastly - many have complained that the phone is too slow with its functions and unstable --- however, ever since the system software was updated to 1.12, it has made the phone much quicker and much more stable!Ordering a new phone today should come with that 1.12 software built into it, alreadyI am a former Treo 300 and 600 user, and the 650 is a wonderful upgrade and worth every penny, considering the bluetooth and software improvementsso buy it!!! - you won\\'t be sorryPS - the Cardo Scala bluetooth earpiece is the best earpiece out there for this phone I purchased the Scala 500 as my first BT headset and I regret it. The company is v-e-r-y slow to respond to email messages to their support box, so call them, don\\'t write.While the sound quality of the unit is very, very good, there are other issues with the unit. First, the fit on my particular ear is horrible... always feeling like it was going to fall off. I never trusted it walking through airports as it just didn\\'t feel secure.Second, the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months. The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose, then broke off. I note that others have metioned the same thing. It just wasn\\'t well constructed. Bummer! I\\'ve replaced it now with another low-cost unit made by Plantronics, but while I miss the sound quality of the Cardo, I am disappointed by their slow support and poor quality. Solid bluetooth headset, particularly considering the price. I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside. It\\'s extremely lightweightSolid bluetooth headset, particularly considering the price. I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside. It\\'s extremely lightweight and can be worn for hours on end without discomfort. I\\'ve only had this for a few days, but so far the battery life seems great as well. I had this headset originally, and then lost it.  After I lost my original, I figured I\\'d give a motorolla one a try, and purchased the most expensive motorolla on the market (H700).Using my treo 650, I COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING people were saying, and got constant complaints that the people I was talking to couldn\\'t hear me well.  The volume was terrible, and so was the sound quality.This headset is SO LOUD that i have to keep it on the 3rd from highest setting.  The clarity is great!  People think I\\'m talking on a land line.  For the $35 bucks, I bought a new one and chucked my motorolla in the garbage.IM SO HAPPY TO HAVE MY SCALA BACK! Let me say up front that I ordered this from Amazon after reading all the glowing reviews, and I\\'ve been fairly disappointed by the performance I\\'ve experienced.  My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint\\'s LG-PM325.First, the audio quality was not good.  If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it\\'s not by hearing.Second, there\\'s the shiny blue light.  When I read other\\'s comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn\\'t think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That\\'s part A.  Part B, the flash results in a very slight audible clicking, not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence, be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you\\'re wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.  Pairing was excellent.  The piece stayed on my head pretty well and comfortably, and making or answering calls was straightforward.I\\'ve returned mine because of the two problems. Probably the biggest compliment you can give this headset is that you\\'ll often forget you\\'re using it.  The Scala 500 is incredibly lightweight and (when adjusted properly to your ear) very comfortable.I\\'m impressed by the controls.  Both the main button and the volume \\'wheel\\' are very accessible and very responsive.  With the Sony HBH35 headset I was constantly dropping calls due to the unresponsive controls.  This never happens with the Scala 500.  Additionally, volume is easily regulated.Pairing with the Motorola MPX220 phone was quick and easy.  Additionally, reconnect is quick and reliable following a disconnect due to powering off one of the units or going out of range.  (Range, by the way, is good; comparable with the HBH35 headset.)You can hear the other party clearly and crisply.  Transmission of your voice, I would say, is good.  Though there\\'s infrequent interferrence (static) on voice transmission, I\\'ve never had anyone complain about difficulty in hearing/understanding me.  There\\'s NO annoying \"bluetooth echo.\"To sum it up:Plusses:  Price, size, weight, comfort, pairing, controls, sound quality, range, responsive customer service.Negatives:  Requires charging cradle (one more thing to haul around if you\\'re traveling), no \\'fuel guage\\' to indicate battery life (red flash comes on, but only when it\\'s close to dying) Works well even in the wind.  Can\\'t listen to music through it with my SLVR though, as expected.  I find I don\\'t use it much though.I set up a shortcut in my SLVR for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset. If I have a bluetooth headset active, it refuses to play music at all - through the built-in speaker or a cable.  But this is the fault of the SLVR.Update:  I dropped it outside, where it got rained on for two days before I found it.  Thoroughly dried it out and turned it on.  Still works! This is my first bluetooth device. Read reviews and considered other headsets costing $50 and $100. Based on reviews and value, got this one. Have used it three days.It works well and came with a good set of accessories. My only complaint really is that the tone of voices on my end sounds a bit like a tin can phone. Intelligibility is not a problem, but the sound is a bit disconcerting. Most people I talk to say it sounds fine on the other end, but one complained of the \"tunnel sound.\"But it is a good value. It synched with my T-Mobile Wing right away. I think it dropped a couple of calls, but cannot be certain where the blame lies. I just walked away from the phone and when I came back it reconnected immediately.Other comments: The eyeglasses clip is a great idea but I\\'ll have to modify it to work with my thin wire frames. The ear clip is fine. The supplied neck cord is a good idea, but I\\'m not using it. The belt clip seems a bit vulnerable as it sticks out pretty far.Mine was missing the full manual (a return?), but the online PDF was easy to find.Overall, I did expect slightly better performance, but am satisfied with the value and general function of this headset. I was so lucky to find this headsetI use a Treo 650 ----- I have tried a variety of headsets, including all of the Moto\\'s --- the Scala is clearly the BEST for the Treo 650, and likely, many others1. The volume was very good --- louder than any other headset I used with the Treo 6502. The connection times are usually very fast too ----- most headsets take awhile to establish a connection, but this one usually takes just a second or less, and of course, automatically picks up both outbound and inbound calls3. 90% of the people I talk to say that they can hear me very loudly and clearly --- rarely do I get a \\'barrel\\' effect going with this headset, as many others produce4. The wind-noise-cancelling technology is for real --- I have talked a couple times outside, in blizzards with this thing on --- quality was loud and clear on both ends, despite the high winds!However, it seems that I have to re-connect the pairing for this device, every now and then (maybe once every 3 weeks or so) ---- otherwise, I\\'m very happyPretty good talk time and battery, and of course, the volume is great!Check it out in new colors ---- clear, blue, and red!Lastly - the price cannot be beat!highly recommended! - HAPPY TALKING!!!!! I specifically ordered this headset because of the eye glass clip.  When I received the order, the clip would not fit on my glasses, and appeared to be of extreme poor contstruction (the type you would expect out of a Craker Jack box).The headset would required pressing the button to answer a call several times before it would actually pick up the call.The product is in the process of being returned to Amazon.com. Let me begin this review by stating that a lot of people have used this device quite successfully.  As for me, there were two main problems.  First, I found the sound level to be too low.  While it\\'s easy enough to turn up the volume, the problem lies in the microphone being so close that it causes a major echo for the person on the other end.  The second problem I had was that I was never able to transfer a call from the device to the phone.  I tried to use this model for a couple weeks just to make sure but, after that time, I decided to send it back and keep looking. Compared to Motorola Bluetooth headsets, this Cardo really rocks. It has much better mic and speaker sound quality and volume than Motorola. The Motorola makes me sound like I\\'m talking on a speakerphone while the Cardo is a bit better in this regard.That said, because the mic is so far away from your mouth, you will still sound very distant and a bit muffled. With this Cardo, callers still complain when I\\'m in the car or outside on a windy day that there is a lot of background wind noise.I ended up going back to the wired headset that came with my Motorola RAZR phone, which has much better audio quality and is not as cumbersome to setup during a call as a Bluetooth headset. I am using this device with a Polycom landline phone.Trying the 3 settings I can get a decent connection on my end with a separate Bluetooth earpiece, where I hear the other party fine with little noise and no echo.But on the far end, even landline to landline, there is an annoying whine and some echo, no matter what the setting.  This isn\\'t good enough, I prefer to use the corded headset.I am returning this product to Amazon. I use a nextel i730 and this jabra adapter fits on the back perfectly with velcro. (adapter is approx 1/8 thin)  The adapter has 3 tiny setting to adapt to different phones and I find setting #2 to work fine with my motorola HS820 wireless earpiece. This adapter works on Nextels direct connect and regular phone calls, my last adapter would not do the direct connect. So far I have had the adapter and earpiece on for over 16hrs with out a charge, while receiving many phone calls and direct calls during these hours. Can\\'t wait till Nextel comes out with a bluetooth phone but till then, this is the only way to go! I bought, exchanged, and then returned this unit.  Both units delivered to me would not turn on.  When I charged them using the supplied adaptor, the red charging light came on and a few hours later, the unit was supposedly fully charged.  However, when I attempted to turn the unit on by pressing the power button, nothing happened.  The unit never came on, could not be paired, and never worked.  I returned both of them.  I can understand one unit being bad, but two units that were shipped several weeks apart shouldn\\'t be.When I called for technical support, I waited on hold for sometime, and then gave up. I bought this item @ a local retailer, was happy cause i got it on sale (probobly clearance) well it worked 2 days then the wire going into the unit it self would get static if touched!  I can not find my receipt, so i e-mailed jabra & they are acting like this isn\\'t an issue! wanting to know how many phones i tried, if i tried more than 1 headset, etc.... i will prolly get no where or if they do accept a return the S&H Charges will be stupid & not worth replacement!  Just get a nice wired headset, less $ spent & less headache! Ok. I just bought this adapter today for my PDA cellphone.  The product integrates well with everything (My Laptop - sony vaio, cellphone (siemens sx56, my panasonic cordless home phone (although with the panasonic, ppl complain about my voice being faint)).  But the issue is , I hear static crackling noises even if I\\'m not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter, it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue, as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured, if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset, then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet , it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (1,2,3) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet, the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one, to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.  The manual says, that it is due to interference.  I think many 2.4 Ghz can cause this inteference.  Alhtough I turned off all of my wireles devices, it still caused the issue even in my car (slightly better, but not totally gone).But in any case if you don\\'t hear the crackling, it integrates very well with everything.  The crackling is heard only by you, not by the person on the other side.  So we can probably live with it.  There are not many bluetooth adapters that are available out there.Note: Many reviewers here complain about this adpater not working well with home phones.  First of all, if you read the manual, this is not designed to work with home phones (if it works well with home phones, then you\\'re lucky).  It is designed to work primarily for mobile phones only. Perfect for my Contour Roam GPS camera.  I got two of these to have as powered spares, along with a portable charger (that also charges via USB), so I can always keep one charging, one charged, and one being used! I bought this from Amazon to have an alternate batters from my GPS logger and it gets the job done. Its cheap and worth the price... I bought this battery to replace the one in my dash cam. i charged it up like the instructions said to do, and wow. i can use my dash cam a long time before plugging it in to the power point in my truck.the price of this battery is really good for the service that you will receive from it.if you need a new battery get one of these. After searching and searching for a battery for our baby monitor -- the Levana BABYVIEW20, I found out that it uses this Nokia battery. I was too nervous to buy this type of product for any seller other than Amazon. I did just that and it works and fits perfectly. I could NOT get it charge. Did not sent it back because it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it. I ask for help on this and got no where. But I did order Nokia BL-5C and it works great. It was because I could no longer obtain good quality BL-5C\\'s that I finally gave up my Nokia phone.I think the last battery I tried in it was one of these, it actually had worse performance than the battery I had used for a year and was trying to replace.These might be phonies from China or just so old that they are chemically inert, but I am afraid I can\\'t recommend these. After 6 months of use, the battery still performance well.  I can\\'t tell if this battery is genuine or not. No issues at all with this battery order.  Its an OEM Nokia BL-5C battery as advertised.  Nothing exciting and performance is as it should be for a new battery.  Price was excellent as compared to retail, so I am very satisfied with purchase. I purchased this for my father-in-law. His battery was about to wear out its welcome. It arrived ahead of scheduled date, and has not had a problem with it. Got this is a timely mannor, put it in my phone, chatged for 12+ hours and nothing ! Never worked ! Annoyed to say the least ! I ordered this just in time to go into the hospital for a ce section so i wouldnt have to charge my phone all that often considering bending and such will be painfull. A lot of good it did me. I recently purchased two of these batteries for my four-year-old Nokia cell phones.  Based on about a month\\'s trial, both batteries seem to hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time... much better than the old batteries.  Seem to be a good choice, especially for the money. The nice thing about this battery in my case, is that it came fully charged and ready to use.  It fit perfectly in the phone as I would have expected.  It\\'s an excellent buy compared to other sources. I purchased this battery for a premium as it boldly proclaimed &#34;Li-Ion&#34;.  That purchase was before I noted that all of the other, more inexpensive batteries were also Li-Ion types, and also OEM.  My fault for not paying attention.  Be advised there are better prices for this exact item on Amazon, so please keep looking.This having been said, the item was shipped quickly, and arrived so fast that I almost had to duck.  I therefore have no issues with the seller, who is doing a good job. Works.  Good quality battery.  What more can I say about a battery?  It fits.  It charges.  It powers.  It\\'s a battery at a very reasonable price. I bought this is a gift for my brother. He loves it! It works perfectly with his iPhone 5 and even works with Siri. Loving it. Clearly sound on calls, long live battery and comfort ear hock. I trust all of Motorola Bluetooth Headset. Overall, an OK headset that, versus the H700, trades better inbound voice quality for less outbound quality. Given its low price, though, it\\'s a great value, though I can see why some RAZR and PEBL boxes include this for *free*. My report card:Design: A-, nice simple design. Buttons are few and easy to use, though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A-, it\\'s attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A, it\\'s a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it\\'s lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very \"floppy\" fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced \"speakerphone\" effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call. THIS IS FALSE. You must leave the H500 turned on and actively connected to your phone in order to use it, just like any other headset. I bought this Bluetooth as a back-up for my pretty pink Motorola H500. Therefore, I placed it in the drawer until I needed a replacement, and last night i needed it. I plugged it up for a couple of hours and tried to pair it to my new phone and it did not work. I then charged it overnight and again tried to pair it and nothing (not one indicator light). I plugged the blue-tooth back into to the charger, it had a steady blue light and i tried pairing it to my phone while it was on the charger and it worked; unfortunately, i can not walk around with a charger and outlet attached to my head. Consequently, this was a lemon and due to the months passed from my internet purchase, i am unable to return it or exchange.Therefore, the moral of the story is to test everything you purchase from the internet. I learned a valuable lesson. The device was not as the description. It looked as if someone dropped it off their vehicle and it hit the road and skidded all the way down. I was VERY disappointed when opening it b/c it was the first thing I seen other than the front damage.I did email the seller and told them and they were very nice and refunded me as I returned the product back to them. was very unhappy with this it didnt work no time i had got it for my husband and i haven heard the last of it from him This probably isn\\'t being sold any more, but I really enjoyed my time with it.  It lasted me three years!  Compared to the new ones out, this is bulky and sound quality isn\\'t as good.  But the fact that it remained in tact in working condition, especially with a rechargeable battery is remarkable. This bluetooth is basically ok but the part holding on to your ear is very \\'flimsey\\' and tends to want to fall off if u bend over so u have to keep securing it on your ear, which is quite annoying as I almost lost it a few times not realizing it was no longer on my ear...so it\\'s a huge drawback for me. It seems to work ok otherwise tho sometimes I do have a  sound problem that is not present when I just listen straight from the phone without it...it\\'s sometimes quite garbled. So this product for me though cute, is average in fuction. I have paired this with an unlocked RAZR, and so far they both have worked great (2 months).It fits well on both ears, not so big, and the voice quality is very good. I also found the price from amazon, really competitive I STILL USE IT TILL THIS DAY. IT HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN. I LOVE IT. HEADPHONES CAN\\'T EVEN TOUCH THIS! While this doesn\\'t have the range of the Nokia bluetooth headset i tried, it is vastly more comfortable.  I\\'ve used it with a Samsung t809 and had no issues with it over a couple days before this review. Range was about the 30 feet they are supposed to have, beyond that signal fading was rapid. Very light, easy to use and fortunately mid range signal tones. The Motorola H500 is a very good unit.  It has excellent sound quality and is easy to operate.  The only negative thing is it does hurt the ear after wearing it for awhile. Bought two of these yesterday.  Pink one for the lady and grey for me.Voice quality, both incoming and outgoing is excellent.  So light, you can wear it for hours w.o. a problem - you forget it is there.  Volume is definitely loud - but can be adjusted, if you want.We are using it w. SE r520m phones - first generation (\"years\" ago) that had BT built-in.I had bought a Cardo \"Allways\" head set in 12/03.  It was so cumbersome, neither of us really used it. It was uncomfortable.I can see I\\'ll be using this most of the day.  I am a heavy cel phone user - 2000 min./mo. - mostly day time.I find it strange in reading reviews of these items that some find a model to be quite good in a feature (eg. volume) and others find the same model unacceptable.  Since no two people have the same size OR shape ears, probably a headset should be tried on for fit before purchase - just like you would a pair of shoes....mt The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:)  The H500 works fine with our LG Shine.  Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well, not too bad really).It was an easy setup.  The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why not 3 stars?  The volume control is hardly palpable.  It is hard to adjust the volume while in use.  Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust.  Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear.  It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear. I bought an H500 a few years ago when it first came out. It was plagued with low volume and poor connection. After using a nokia bluetooth for the last year I got this one again because of the no cell phone laws in California as of July 1st.This headset is plenty loud with my Sony Ericsson T650i and I haven\\'t had it drop the bluetooth connection yet. The volume sits a little below half and I can hear perfectly in the car. Battery life rocks and voice clarity is a lot better than I remembered it with the first H500.4 out of 5 stars because the ear clip is flimsy and doesn\\'t allow the H500 to sit tightly against your ear. So if you\\'re planning on using this while running or during an intense walk - don\\'t count on it.Definitely recommend this as a great bluetooth device. Can\\'t go wrong with the price! I bought two of these. One fits over my ear perfectly while the second unit takes a little more time to secure because the ear hook is kind of loose. They\\'re both plenty loud enough, clear reception, good range (phone can be two rooms away), and people on the other side of the call say they couldn\\'t tell I was on a headset.Great performance considering the price paid. This Bluetooth sucks. Plain and simple... I mean I paid, what, $15 for the thing so wasn\\'t expecting the best but at least working quality. I always buy the Motorola H730 or H750 which are upwards of $60 but I always lose them. Always! It is a curse so I figured I would get a rinky-dink cheap one so I wouldn\\'t cry in the corner losing out on a day&#8217;s worth of work pissed and distraught over losing my (what is this my 6th) Bluetooth. But with every call - EVERY ONE - it was unbearable static on my end so much so that everyone mentioned it. Hell, even the recorded lady on the voicemail was like this thing sucks! So yeah just spend the extra cash and go up a few grades because this was a lost cause. Very pleased with this purchase, excellent sound quality when speaking and listening. Also, the plug for the charger is sturdy and a good fit for the headset. I needed a BT headset for the longest time.....since I never used one and was getting worried that I may get busted one day.  I saw this on Gold Box and ordered it immediately for $15....how could you go wrong?It is intended for use primarily with a Blackberry Javelin (8900).  It paired quickly has held a charge for 2.5 days thus far (light-moderate usage).  My opinion is that it does what it should at its price point and I was not expecting a miracle.If you are looking for a BT set that has loads of noise canceling and voice detection..then this is not for you.  Look for a Jawbone by Aliph...The H500 is a model that has been around a long time and is perfect for my needs.  I just wish it were a bit louder and thus I am giving it a 4/5.Great value, great item. This is my first bluetooth headset so I don\\'t have anything to compare it to, but so far it seems to be pretty good. It\\'s small, very lightweight, and comfortable. It\\'s hard to judge the comfort of this device unless you try it yourself because everyone\\'s ear and head are different.I\\'m using it with a Motorola Razr V3m from Verizon. It paired easily and quickly. The connection is a little crackly even right next to the phone, which surprised me, but it\\'s not so bad that it takes away from a conversation. Naturally, the further you get from your phone the reception deteriorates. Volume and clarity are fine and sound just like holding my phone up to my ear.Overall it\\'s a good headset and fine for my purposes. Only a few drawbacks: the volume and call buttons are a little hard to manipulate, and it would be nice if the unit could be held tighter against my head. Right off I have to say that when it comes to cell service and phones and the inherent contracts: you get what you pay for, in more ways than one, and buyer beware!  I do my research, ad nauseum, before getting into a new contract or into bed with a new cell provider. I\\'ve been a Nextel subscriber for two years with an i90 and an i730. Both lovely phones - service very professional from Nextel - coverage and features what I expected.  But like I said, I researched that to death before I bought their phones or their service.  Got the phones from Amazon.I, too, was taken by the looks of the RAZR, and so was my wife once she saw one.  But was it as good as it looked and was it worth and worth switching carriers for?  For one, Nextel wasn\\'t making it easy to stay with them - they got into bed with Sprint and I had Sprint for years and still have nightmares about their customer service.  (Plus, the price for an \"upgrade phone\" for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view.  Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact!)I got two RAZR\\'s at a local retailer - sorry Amazon, but your rebates with Cingular aren\\'t worth the effort - and paid $99 each, best price *anywhere.*  I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon\\'s and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel.  A *bunch* of money.  Two words: rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone, reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well, if not better, than my i730, which is a *great* phone, and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony, Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have.  I repeat: I read some of the manual, which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book, shame on you.  I was worried about the address book based on reviews, but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone, I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some.  There are so many ways to configure the address book it\\'s silly.  You can assign and create \"categories\"  for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life, the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it, better than half the phones on the market today.  I can say that cos I feel like I\\'ve researched about half the phones on the market ... :)  Do this: plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night.  I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone? How clumsy are you?  I\\'ve beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it.  Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot, which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times.  I\\'m happy with the material and it\\'s expected durability.  Stop throwing your delicate, *expensive,* micro-electronic device around like it\\'s made of teflon.  *Be careful.*I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it\\'s nature usually expensive and difficult.  (A good example is the ROKR, the so-called iTunes phone.  I have an iPod, and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod,I would have bought it, but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that isn\\'t the easiest thing to pull off well ...) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink  of an eye.  It\\'s expensive because it\\'s a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious.  Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities, so don\\'t be surprised by that.  Want a good camera phone for Cingular? The Sony s710 got great reveiws; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs.  That\\'s the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it\\'s not working out for me.  So there\\'s a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone.  Still, I did my research so there wouldn\\'t be too many surprises when I got the phone.Hope this helps. The phone is ok. I didn\\'t find any difference between RAZR and the Motorolla V300 I had earlier. All the features are the same.Razr has a big huge color screen, bluetooth enabled and can capture videos. But there is no improvement on any of the calling features.So if you are getting the phone free after the rebates you can buy it, else it is not worth the $200. I\\'ll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated.1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can\\'t add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the \"MORE\" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife\\'s Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn\\'t loud enough. Plus, the \"audio sweet spot\" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn\\'t keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola\\'s own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? \"Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.\"4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don\\'t buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile\\'s support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says \"Sorry, we don\\'t offer games for your phone yet\". My wife\\'s V330 has a similar issue. She\\'s had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn\\'t buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn\\'t get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto\\'s part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn\\'t responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I\\'ve managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don\\'t. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I\\'m a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I\\'ve had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I\\'ve still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I\\'ve seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I\\'m lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I\\'ve not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven\\'t played around with the software yet, so I\\'m going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven\\'t had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR\\'s connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn\\'t matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I\\'d be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times. The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.  Let\\'s face it - for guys who don\\'t like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option.  This phone is far and away the best one in that regard.  I forget it\\'s there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn\\'t wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size. This is one great phone, sleek, light, small, thin. Motorola got the form exactly right, just slightly larger than a credit card, and only a half an inch thick. The screen is excellent.Motorola missed big time on this one, not including Motorola Phone Tools and a USB cable in the purchase - now how cheap is that. I just spent all that money on a super exclusive cool phone, and they make me buy software for $30? That\\'s actually kind of crazy.They also messed up on the phone book. 450 Outlook contacts, that were spawned from 200 core contacts - each cell phone, business, email, and home entry for an individual is a separate entry. Way way too unwieldy. They need to update this error big time. They\\'ve also missed on priority numbers - you know, you identify people you call a lot, and they go to the head of the list. I\\'m used to the problems now, but wow what a miss on their part.The camera, oh it takes pictures. They look decent on the cell phone, but forget much more. The shutter speed must be very slow, you have to hold the phone solid to not get blurry pictures (when viewed on a computer screen full size) - on the phone they look great.Overall - my nits are truely nits, this is one heck of a great phone. If you\\'re price sensitive, buy the V500 series. If you want cool, get this one.By the way, I\\'m a long time ATT customer and had no trouble (read it took less than 10 minutes to buy and activate this phone) with Cingular. In fact the service seems better. I just wish they would port over your voice mail. I bought this becasue I was very happy to see a phone with a metal case again.  I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me.  Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away.  The best phone I ever had.  Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos.  Really big disapointment.  Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia.  When this came out I jumped on it.  Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones.PROS:-Some what sturdy case.  The metal parts seem solid. No marks as of yet (1 month).-The battery life is a little tiny bit higher then your average phone.  I have to charge it at night but it has at least half the life left on it.  I talk for about 3 hours a day.-Camera is ok not the best and by far not the worst.-Slim form factor.  And yes its wider then your normal flip but this is a good size.  Other phones always seemed to skinny for me.CONS:-Not all of it is metal.  The bottom is plastic and it seems to be cheap plastic.  It creaks when you push on it.  I think that is where the antenna is, and if it has a SAR rating of .80 (I think) at the ear then I wonder how much your jaw is getting.  Rather my jaw get cancer then my brain right?-The vol is almost a joke it is so low.  At the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting.  I used to have to turn people down on my cell, now I am struggling to hear them sometimes.-The keypad looks nice but its a pain in the butt.  The donut thing in the middle is already scracthed by my finger nail.  The rest of the keypad is protected it seems and has no marks.-A pain to clean.  The keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it.  When you clean it the rubber lining between the keys grabs part of what ever cloth you are using and gets it looking even worse.-Phone book.  Good god man.  The fact that they used this phone book really shows that either they don\\'t put a lot of effort into the phone or was a total mess up.  Either way it is a true shame.-Good luck with support and warranty from Moto.  Past experiences with them was very poor.  You send your phone to get fixed and a month later you get it back and they didn\\'t even read what the problem was before they \"fix\" it and send it back still broken.The reason they make phones out of cheap plastic in my opinion is because what do you do 6 months after your phone looks like you dropped it down the stairs a few dozen times.  You buy another.  Strong durable plastic is used all the time.  For crying out loud Glad uses it all the time.  I am more then happy to pay 600 dollars on quality and if you have the money do the same.  This phone is not even close to meeting my expectations of what I thought I would get for a 600 dollar \"basic\" cell phone.  I have high standards and for top dollar I want the best.  Moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now. 250 or something on Amazon as of now.  Well worth it for that price.To the other reviewer about Verizon.  They use CDMA and this phone is only for GSM.  I doubt they will ever make a CDMA version.  But of course I have no real clue.  Call Motorola.Also sorry for my spelling mistakes and all.  It would take to much time to go back and review what I wrote.  I am not getting paid for this and won\\'t waste my time.  Good luck and I think you will be very happy with this phone over all. I have been a Nextel user for years and their Motorola products including i90, i95, i730 and i830.  The v3 is the best Motorola product ever!!! Blows the i830 out the water and makes it look like yesterdays news. Superior and striking good looks and is solidly built - no, it does not look cheap as some previous reviewer stated. I live in GA and Cingular reception is very good. Paired my v3 with Bluetrek G2 bluetooth headset(received rave reviews and is cheap - pick one up on ebay) and I wonder what took me so long to get on board. I did fear Cingular\\'s merger with AT&T; since I had AT&T; years ago and their reception was terrible.I\\'ll never go back to Nextel as they do not appreciate their customers and their Motorola products do not have Bluetooth except Blackberry. Plus who wants to carry around a brick in their pocket? I\\'m a woman and typically carry v3 in my purse but sometimes for convenience I just want to put it in my jean pocket. And I forget it\\'s there...This v3 has superior browser technology, email and text messaging, good camera and great voice record. Yes, the address book is different but you get used to it. Anyways, I only put important people that I call frequently in address book so it\\'s not a problem for me. I primarily make lots of calls and like to check news and send a few text messages. A+++++++ Sexy form... CHECK. Innovative construction... CHECK. Exclusive price tag... CHECK. In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike, the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such. If you\\'re looking for a feature rich phone, then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less. But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams, &#34;look at me, I\\'m a sexy b*tch,&#34; then the V3 is up your alley.Actually, a better analogy would be: The Acura NSX of mobile phones. Like the NSX, I feel the V3 is a marketing tool for Motorola. It\\'s their way of saying, &#34;We\\'re known for inexpensive phones, but, look, we can build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;Unless wireless technology improves from GSM, the V3 is a phone that I can definitely keep for more than 2 years. The styling, design, and construction is just that good (I upgraded from a trusty and reliable, yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone).There\\'s been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I\\'ve heard is that the bottom backside (below the battery cover) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna. It certainly makes perfect sense to me (unless the metal frame IS the antenna) as all the other areas are cold to touch (in this weather) while those areas are usually room temperature. Furthermore, it would be misrepresentation on Motorola\\'s part to advertise it as such. Regardless, this phone may seem flimsy, but it\\'s very solid -- there is no comparison w/ my old Nokia 3360 and my girlfriend\\'s V551.Mikey\\'s likeys:1- The mini-USB port. This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it\\'s simple and should be a mobile phone standard!2- The Bluetooth connectivity. Coming from a wired hands-free setup, my Bluetooth headset (a Jabra BT250) is a godsend. I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room. (SIDE NOTE: stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details)3- Quad band. Doubtful that I\\'ll ever use this feature/benefit, but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone. I\\'ve been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones, but I\\'ve got to admit, the V3\\'s speaker phone is the bomb. It\\'s loud and clear (but not loud enough for the car). My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup. When I don\\'t have my Bluetooth headset, I\\'m spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display. Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks, I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display. And not only that, the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator! All other phones (excluding PDA phones) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey\\'s no-likeys:1- No memory expansion. I don\\'t see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory, but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice. Maybe Motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner\\'s manual. I have found that the owner\\'s manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own. It does not explain how to use many common features that owners (especially ones new to Motorola phones) use. Instead, it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together. It\\'s like the &#34;C++ Reference&#34; vs &#34;Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days.&#34; Maybe Motorola\\'s technical writers are just to technical?3- Drops and dings. Like any &#34;Ferrari,&#34; I\\'ll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone. I\\'m hoping there will be [good] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket. (SIDE NOTE: I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone, but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance)4- No EDGE. My girlfriend\\'s $99 Motorola v551 has EDGE. Shame, shame, shame Motorola. Bad Motorola. Bad, bad, bad. Alas, it\\'s akin to buying a $160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k for an Acura NSX and it\\'s only 290hp).5- Internal display colors. I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors, but Motorola\\'s specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors, but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback. Very, very, sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone. PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers (you don\\'t have to do this if a name only has one number);2- set the address book view to &#34;Primary Contacts&#34; in Phonebook Menu &#62;&#62;&#62; Phonebook Setup &#62;&#62;&#62; View;3- voila, only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia\\'s implementation (refer to my owner\\'s manual dis-like above), but I have found Motorola\\'s implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE: It\\'s been nearly three weeks since I\\'ve bought this phone and no buyer\\'s remorse. I\\'ve had this phone for a while now and here\\'s what I think.The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people, and yes, it\\'s not as intuitive as say, Nokia\\'s interface, but it does have some pros.  You can customize every button, including all 4 arrows, and the left and right soft keys.  I have my left soft key programmed to go to \"Shortcuts\" and I have every function I need right there.  And of course, after a while of use, you will get used to the interface.The volume of the phone is decent.  I have no problems hearing other people, and they have no problems hearing me.  Speakerphone works great too.  My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he\\'s talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls.  The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring.  One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this:  If you use your SIM card to store your addresses, then no, you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person.  But if you use your phone\\'s memory to store your numbers, you can have many many numbers stored to each entry.  I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook\\'s address book, so I\\'m not too worried about having them on my SIM card.  And if you have a MAC, iSync works wonders with syncing numbers/calendars to the RAZR....now THAT\\'S cool!The screen is very large and clear.  I have no problems seeing it in dark or even bright light.  I have had no problems with reception with Cingular so far.  In fact, I have a stronger signal in most places than my previous phone (Nokia 6230)Overall, I am very pleased with the design, functions, and asthetics of this phone. Bought this phone(Actually the black v3 but the only real difference is video support and additional memory), for $149 from BB, replacing my v551, basically just for the \"chic factor\". Initally I was very happy and excited with my purchase, but after a couple of weeks the novelty wore off and its shortcomings became apparent. The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece. Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random \"sweet spot\\' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments. I even removed the little \"M\" circle with little or no help. The second shortcoming is the the screen. While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good. And if you are viewing blacks and not looking directly at it, you get a wierd grey-black thing going on with one eye. Kind of hard to explain, except for those of you with the phone. Much to my dismay the screen is actually WORSE than the one on the v551. The third is the camera. I rarely use a phone cam, but the times I needed it, the pictures looked, well...horrible. And last but not least, the reception. The reception is not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The v551 actually had better reception. My new LG CE500 actually has MUCH better reception and is generally a much better phone. This phone is a GOOD phone. Nothing more nothing less. I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710. Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry. The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software. Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710. To bad, the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me. If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it. Bought this phone with Cingular service. I needed the phone in a hurry. I checked my order next day, had this weird message:\"Order RevisionOrder placed October 08, 2005 at 10:35 PM PDTOpen order -- your order revision requiredhas not approved you for any phone and service plan packages. Please cancel necessary phone and service plan packages from your order. We cannot proceed with your order without some action on your part. Please be aware that if you do not take action on this item within 5 DAYS, it will be cancelled from your order.Cancel necessary phone and service plan packages\"I had no idea what this cryptic message meant, but essentially they were requiring me to cancel the order. I have three cell phones in my family, perfect credit, no earthly reason why I wouldn\\'t be approved for a cell phone account, just the above message with no explanation. Of course, there is no one at Amazon to call for an explanation. I don\\'t know if my form was missing some information, or something was mistyped - no idea at all what happened. I think that if Amazon was going to cancel my order, they need to explain it to me.I have bought from Amazon before, usually good service, but this is just awful.I think that Amazon is in over their heads in the cell phone business.From other comments, it sounds like Amazon is not being fully honest or transparent in their cell phone ads. If you look carefully at these so called \"bad reviews\" you will notice most of them either don\\'t know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one. Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a \"shared plan\" from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your \"Cell phone Numbers\" right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a \"single 700 rollover mins shared plan\" before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to \"My Account\" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don\\'t recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular \"in my area\" puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away \"With NO ROAMING charges\" btw our last cell phone service \"Alltel\" would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in \"Speaker Phone\" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call \"Mobile to Mobile\".We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I\\'ve had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it \"needs\" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I\\'m easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that\\'s with a lot of fiddling around with it because it\\'s new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the \"address book being slow\" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don\\'t, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by \"Name\" or \"Speed dial #\" or \"Voice name\" or even by \"Email\" and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for \"Voice command\" it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for \"list only\" \"no picture\" and by \"primary number only\", simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in \"Categories\" such as \"Business/Personal/General/VIPs\"Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have \"primary number only\" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to \"Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers\" once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about \"ear piece volume too low\"  the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the \"volume\" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the \"top edge of the phone\", too low and volume will sound low. Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose \"PHONE\" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under \"sunlight\" is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE: 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones, neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use (these are our only phones, we only have cell phone service no land line).The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them. I live in an area where Cingular service is really good; I have experienced virtually no dropped calls.  The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively.  My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement.  It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner.  I was concerned about the thickness and durability.  This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone.My old accessories don\\'t fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do?I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3.0 by Avanquest for my previous phone.  I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4.0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone.  With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I don\\'t have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip.  I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone\\'s memory and I use it as my wallpaper.My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola.  On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning.  I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying.The Razr and my Jabra work well together.  It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes.So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone. I had a Samsung X427 before this and it was awful. Dropped calls, poor reception, wouldn\\'t hold a charge. This phone changed my opinion completely. It does everything I need and then some, and the camera/video is a bonus. The only downside and the difference between 4 & 5 stars was that it did not behave well with my Jabra EarWrap-the remote button did not work-and the speakerphone is a joke. But speakerphone is not really what I needed, it was reliability and function.Really a far step forward-I recommend it for anyone needing a reliable phone. My wife and I each purchased V551s with our migration to Cingular 6 months ago. In that time (during which the phone was never dropped, bumped, etc), I\\'ve replaced my phone twice, and hers once. The problems we\\'ve had include:- random \"white screen of death\"- Bluetooth connectivity problems (isolated to phones)- dropped calls in perfect reception areas- random battery indications- the infamous \"Unable to Charge\" problemAdd to that Motorola\\'s lousy phonebook and UI, and retarded Bluetooth handling (e.g., if any BT device is connected, the same Moto default ring sounds, regardless of sound profile or caller-specific ringtones), and you have an overpriced, overhyped, oversize paperweight.I\\'m fortunate Cingular offers my company\\'s employees discounts on new phones, so that I can go back to Sony Ericsson. My old T616 gave me 2 years of perfect service, even after having been dropped twice. It\\'s on its 2nd owner now, who has used it for 6 months problem-free. I bought this phone because it was a Editors choice in a leading computer magazine.  I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can\\'t believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won\\'t be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can\\'t believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3\\'s to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don\\'t waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won\\'t need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User\\'s who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks. I\\'ve had this phone for about four months now, and I haven\\'t had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces.  I do charge it every night; however, I\\'ve found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don\\'t need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don\\'t feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends\\' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I\\'m entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I\\'ll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it\\'s VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I\\'ve tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular\\'s services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn\\'t really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone. My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket. There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu\\'s when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling. I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i don\\'t know whether its the service or phone. Overall i want to like the phone but i\\'m searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it. Bottom LineStrongly recommended.  This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it.  Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum).  From the many online reviews I\\'ve read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls.  I haven\\'t seen many of those types of comments lately so I\\'m assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros--Very good reception and sound quality.  Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It\\'s nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly).  Nice raised number keys.--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ringtones; also extensive selection of built in ringtones (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals).--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn\\'t with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn\\'t actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I\\'ve used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it\\'s fine.  You can store five numbers and an email per entry. (You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing).  It\\'s not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works.--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto\\'s recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it\\'s fine.  Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use.  (As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically.)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60.  But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds.  You have to touch a key to make it come back on.  This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user\\'s manual doesn\\'t explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that\\'s the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky.  As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds).--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I\\'ve had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user\\'s manual--Lousy user\\'s manual--Did I mention the lousy user\\'s manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal.  In other words, it \"learns\" one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase.--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off: I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC)--I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal.--The synchronization software (Motorola Mobile Phone Tools)and cable cost extra.  I have not been able to make it function.  Motorola\\'s support is utterly worthless--I asked for help online and they told me to call them.  Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person.  The software developer--BVRP--is trying to help but hasn\\'t been able to fix the problem.  I may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software. I didn\\'t like it but my husband seems to think that it works great for him and uses it often. Doesn\\'t stay on even if you figure out how to get it on. The ear plug piece is big and bulky and then you can\\'t hear. The mouth piece is way too short so no one can hear you talk over the car and road noise.  The cord is too short and there is not volume control on the cord with is inconvenient. Get the Bluetooth and give up the wire. I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven\\'t replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.$10?  I\\'m buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my \\'backup\\', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I\\'m wondering what phones other reviewers have that won\\'t let them adjust the volume? This fell apart after one use, and the person I called couldn\\'t even hear me when it wasn\\'t broken to pieces.  VERY disappointed! :( This model, the C150, is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered. I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used, however, all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality. With each one, the persons on the other end could not hear me. Disappointed. I found that it worked well with a cell phone, but not with a cordless phone. The only downside with this headset is that the first one I owned broke after about 2 years of use. First the ear \"hook\" piece broke off. Then the 2.5mm jack broke while in a plug - I\\'m only glad it was in an adapter and not my phone at the time or it would have ruined the phone.I bought another one and it works fine. Hopefully that broken 2.5mm jack was a one-time thing. Otherwise the sound quality and fit are great. The reviewer who says the ear piece is too snug should use a smaller ear piece - there are 3 different sizes that come with the headset for each ear. I screwed up; shouldn\\'t have ordered this; it\\'s of no use to me.  Since the real price was hidden in the \"shipping and handling\" it\\'s pointless to return it; I\\'ll just write it off as an \"educational expense\".I actually bought this to use on a cordless handset that had a \"hands free\" 2.5mm jack. (Siemens cordless phone system).  The owners manual says \"...any 2.5 mm headset\", so that\\'s what I bought.  I don\\'t even know where this thing is anymore; I put it back in the little bag and forgot about it.I tried it on three of the handsets in the system; the plug simply captures the line and makes a loud, \"screeching\" sound...  ...playing with the plug, I can find one tenuous position about a quarter of the way out where I can hear audio from the phone, but the moment I let it slip it goes back to the screeching.I can\\'t get it to work on anything else either including my wife\\'s Samsung Intensity (which also has a 2.5mm headset jack; same results), but I don\\'t have access to a PalmEvery so often I do something stupid; buying this was one of those occasions. These did not work since the day I got them.The right earbud never had sound.I got a replacement, and it\\'s the same situation.I am not sure if it\\'s because I\\'m using a Nokia E71x, but they both don\\'t work properly. There\\'s a problem with the design of this headset. The jack used is too short. It\\'s EXTREMELY sensitive to movement. If you don\\'t have it plugged in ALL THE WAY and keep it still, you\\'ll loose the connection. I don\\'t know why they designed it that way... I purchased this headset from BTO, Inc to fit thePalm Centrosmartphone, which as a 3/32\" (not 1/8\") headphone jack. This headset fits and works perfectly.If you are familiar with the mono headset that shipped with older Palm or Handspring Treo phones, this headset is a stereo version. The buds are hard plastic in-the-ear type with a thin cushion (which you must install without tearing). The microphone is on the left bud, and is held close to your mouth because the left side wire is much shorter than the right side. The mic has an answer/hang up button. And the set is terminated by a 3/32\" four conductor plug.The build and sound quality of this set are good. The plug has strain relief and the wiring is thin but more rugged than expected.  The buds have bass ports and the mic capsule is a reasonable size. The Centro has a microSD card for storing MP3 tracks, and this headset does a good job reproducing the dynamic range of classical music.There are better headsets available. But if you want a headset to fit a stereo Treo with a mic, answer button, and decent sound, it\\'s hard to find one that costs less. Four stars instead of five because the bud cushions are thin and tear easy. Great sound, I use my phone for music at the gym so I am moving around and I have had no problems. To get it any cheaper, you have to steal it! I doesn\\'t hold a charge for very long which is to be expected for an inexpensive battery.  You really do get what you pay for, don\\'t you? Great price for Motorola branded batteries.  Works great and seems to last as long as original battery did when new. The first battery received lost it\\'s charge overnight..the vendor replaced it with another look alike that is working better.Not totally happy with the quality but the vendor was responsive and that is important for discount item transactions like this. Oem battery, works great and received in just 3 days! Love the razr but original battery died, bought an aftermarket, it only lasted 9 months, so back to OEM. I lost the charge for my Motorola RAZR V3, and I found this cheap one, surprisingly, it works so great that i asked my frds whoever lost the charger to buy from eforcity I read other reviews before I\\'ve bought this battery and decided to try my luck anyway for 7 bucks :) so, I\\'m here to tell you that it works nice to me, I own it for the month already and still I have 3+ hours for talking and 3 days for stand by!!! Isn\\'t it great?! Of Course it is :)I\\'m glad that I\\'ve tried it, I was even thinking if it won\\'t keep the power for 3 hours for talking I\\'ll need to go in AT&T; store and by original one for $40, the old one that was going with one kept the power for one and a half years. Will see for how long this one will leave. Anywhere else this battery costs at minimum 4 times more. Even with the shipping it\\'s a steal. Grab two or three for backup.A-1 service from A-1 Accessories. I was leary about purchasing the battery because it cost so little.  But I called the vendor and asked if it was a new battery and not used or re-conditioned. The vendor assured me it was a new battery.  It has performed well so far. I bought this thinking I was walking into a bad deal. However, it has been a great battery. I must say, for the price, I was extremely well pleased. This is the 3rd \"OEM\" battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others, it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON\\'s new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders, Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers. I should clarify my review title by saying that this battery is pricey compared to the non-Motorola batteries which mostly received negative reviews. I know someone who bought one of these and had good experience. However I decided to pay more and go for a Motorola replacement. It works well. If it lasts as long as my original Motorola battery (1.5 year), I\\'ll be very satisfied. Replacement batteries are working great.  They take a charge, hold it, and last seemingly as long as the original when it was new. I had my doubts because this product was priced so cheaply, but it has performed very well now and has given my phone noticeable life.  I would highly recommend this product. Product arrived on time. I charged the battery fully and it works as intended with no problems in my phone. They are probably old batteries sitting on a shelf by the time we got them. Not much better than the old ones I was replacing. I purchased three of these batteries and each one would not last through one day in standby (not making calls) before it went dead.  I thought I had a problem with my RAZR V3M so I took it in and was informed that these batteries do not have enough milliamps required for the RAZR.  They replaced it with the correct battery and I have been using that one now for over a year with no problem. I agree with other reviews... people who talk to me hear a horrible echo due to the mic picking up the earspeakers sound... even if I set the earspeaker to the lowest volume.  I\\'m glad it came free with my phone, because if I\\'d payed for this... I\\'d be pretty mad. Can\\'t go wrong for under $25. I bought this when it was $40 and I\\'ve been very happy. I replaced my Jabra headset after I lost it. I think this is actually more comfortable. I\\'ve never had any of the issues described here. It\\'s seems to be very clear and nobody on the other end has ever complained about not being able to understand me. Maybe I just talk louder than everyone else. :) Battery powered so no charging. Item delivered on time, was as described. It works perfectly with very true sound and easy to pair to my phone. This is my second bluetooth headset so I am able to compare this with my previous one (a Plantronics M2500).  Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don\\'t understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won\\'t have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it, it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn\\'t take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter, but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere. The battery life on this unit is great. I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks. (It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.)I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I\\'m sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good.The sound is OK. It\\'s not the best. If it\\'s noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it\\'s sometimes hard to hear.It\\'ll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that\\'s really your first clue about the battery.The earpiece is OK; it\\'s not as secure as I\\'d hope. If you\\'re outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it.Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I\\'m on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it\\'s a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they\\'re always having to charge them. I use rechargeable NiMH AAA\\'s, and they just last a really long time with this unit. Summary: Stay away, this product sports a very poor design...Pro:+ very low price+ very small and lightweight+ relatively easy to use+ pair up well with all my BT phonesCon:- morse-code like feedback signal - they try to accomplish too many tasks with single beep/tone.  1 short beep, 2 short beeps, 3 short beeps, 1 long beep, 3 beeps up, 3 beeps down.  like another reviewer said,  you really have to read the manual or keep it nearyby to be able to understand what all the beeping means.- echos no matter what volume you set it, partly because this thing is very loud- insanely difficult to open the battery door.  I got so frustrated, I was about to throw this thing out of the window.  For a product that use regular batteries, the battery door is the most difficult to open.  Once opened, you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out.  The battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug.  This must be a sick joke by Motorola.  Forget about changing the battery on the go, you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience.  (for the record: this was my breaking point, i had to return this unit, because installing the battery for the first time was enough of a turn-off)- sound quality is mediocre at best I bought a different BoxWave Patent Leather Clutch with magnetic closure and was so impressed by it\\'s functionality. BoxWave changed the style to a snap closure and I didn\\'t realize it until I received it.I\\'m not taking stars away because of my mistake, but by the usual problem I have with snap closures. I have to spend extra time trying to snap it together because it doesn\\'t just close on its own like with a magnet.The case also had marks inside under two of the stitches and shows mark on the patent leather as soon as I run anything slightly against it. I used this case once, maybe twice, had to return to the magnetic BoxWave leather clutch instead. It\\'s shiny which is pretty but that makes it a fingerprint magnet. Its just okay. I buy a lot of cases for my phones because I like to switch them out a lot. This one is nice for the times when you want a dressier case. For everyday I think I will stick with real leather cases from Zenus. They cost a lot more but they they wear well too IF you buy their real leather cases. The case cover creases if you accidentally run your fingernail along it. It\\'s permanent crease. Its bulky so it protects but makes the phone too big. I used to love BoxWave, but this one is a little disappointing.  Why buy a cheap case for your $650 phone. This is a nice case that resembles a wallet because it holds your credit cards and papers while still keeping your Galaxy Note II protected. Quality and value of this item are fine, but WHOA, it smells SO BAD!! Just like bug spray! I returned it promptly. Samsung Note 2 lets face it is a large phone... Howeva I am all about putting it in nice cases. This case hits a stars. Has a credit/ID slots and a money slot - Love that - so I don\\'t have to carry a purse. Plus the strap is nice to have on wrist while on the phone (you know how crazy people are now a days running by snatching phones, extra secure). Best parts phone is secure in case holder when flip case over open. There is an appropriate hole in the back of case for the S-pen removal. Also the phone button closes versus most magnetic closure cases out here.Only con: No Speaker hole in front to close case while talking on phone.Howeva regardless -- highly recommend. Might get another in another color. Bought this for my girlfriend\\'s s3, and she loved it. Having that wrist lanyard is really helpful, and it is a nice looking case for the phone. Fitment is perfect. Also the slick outer sheen is pretty easy to clean off when stuff gets on it, however its somewhat easy to leave indent marks/scratches on if left in a purse with pens or anything sharp.One thing I hadnt noticed from the sellers page was that this case is held together by a snap. It seems like they have now added one picture in which you can kind of see it from the side. This is no a problem, it holds well, but a magnet might have been nice.The only real drawbacks are that when you keep the cover closed for a while, it may leave small horizontal smudge marks on the phone from the card pockets. Also extended use of the phone in this case will cause it to heat up faster than on some of the other cases I\\'ve tried. Both of these can be mildly annoying, but arent really a big problem. The product was OK however the material is somehow cheap looking leather. I am expecting something with more natural feel on it and not the one with shining look. I tried putting my Galaxy S4 in the case and it kept popping out. It seems like the plastic casing is too small for the phone. Very disappointed. I LIKED THE CASE VERY MUCH = BUT I NO LONGER HAVE THE PHONE = SO THE NEW BUYER THAT BOUGHT IT FROM ME AND THE CASE. This is the perfect case for my phone. Even  having a big phone the case makes it feel small and easy to handle.It gives great protection can even take a drop or a slip out of the hand. I love this case the black patent leather makes it a very stylish case. Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all. You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse. Money part needs length to really pack some cash in. Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase.  Id say purchase a cheaper product like this. Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless.  Buyer be aware. Update. I stopped using this. The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it. Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces. Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone. Will take nothing away from the product.  For my personal taste it was a bit bulkier than I prefer. Quality is good no complaints otherwise. This case not only looks fantastic, but it very functional and convenient to carry all the necessities (credit card, id, cash, etc.)  it only smelled like plastic for the first 2-3 minutes after I opened it, which didn\\'t bother me at all. Overall this case is awesome. It\\'s cute, and seems sturdy and well made. Buy it! this case is perfect, the shiny black is just what my girlfreind was looking for, looks sturdy enough to last forever, and there is mini pockets inside the cover, verry nice thanks I actually like this case a lot. I was worried about the price and it being a TPU and all. I have to say, I have a feeling this one is going to last a lot longer than the Spigen Neo-Hybrid I owned for 3 months before it broke. And even better, I can fit all of my charging and headphone devices perfectly, unlike the Spigen. It doesn\\'t make the case bulky, as it may look. It actually feels quite nice in my hands. Overall, I really like this case. If that happens to change eventually, I will absolutely re-review it! i like style, wrist band, good close clip, but once put credit cards in its hard to close. phone stays in ok but if dropped phone will pop out. It\\'s patent so very easy to scratch. However the case is cute. Seems to fit but phone has slid out on multiple occasions out of case. Bought it as a present for my mom to match her purse and she loves it! She likes it better that her &#34;signature&#34; case becasue of the quality Looks and feels like plastic. Like the snap instead of a magnet. Looks better in the picture than in person. Holding up great after a couple of weeks. . It was a very nice case. Well made GREAT color........ But I bought the wrong size. Had to send it back. Not pleased with the first cover she ordered for her Samsung Galaxy Note 2, my wife is loving this one by BoxWave.  She loves the compartments for her ID, credit card, and money.  The fit is good, no problems taking pictures or talking.  She likes the carrying strap as well, and the case\\'s flexibility. I bought this for my daughter to use on her vacation cruise. The magnetic clasp erased her room card and credit card. Kind of defeats the purpose of the clutch. It might be ok if you just used your drivers license phone and cash but people don\\'t really carry cash and to have to have a credit or bank card reissued is problematic. The BoxWave provides good protection for your Samsung Galaxy Note 2, and doesn\\'t provide near as much bulk as the LiviTech Defender Double Layer Hybrid Hard Case.  I still would recommend the Samsung OEM Case over them all. This is a great case for the Note 2.  I had been undecided about whether to use a cover such as this or a belt holster as I\\'ve always used.  I wound up ordering both, this and a REIKO case.  They both work good separately, but not together.  If you try to use both, it is almost impossible to remove the Note 2 from the REIKO as it becomes stuck due to the tight fit.  I decided to use the BoxWave exclusively and have not been dissatisified with my decision.  I simply slide the Note 2 into my front pocket.  And no, the phone isn\\'t too big for my pants pocket.The pros for this case is that it makes the Note 2 look stylish, and due to the rubbery feel, it makes the phone feel quite stable in my hand; however, the rubbery feel doesn\\'t interfere with it going in and out of my pocket.  If I had to come up with a con for the BoxWave Tuxedo Suitup case, it would be that due to its glossiness, it shows fingerprints,  However, they wipe off easily.In summary, I would definitely order one of these cases again. I received this item in Dec. Been using it since then. Wanted to make sure I liked it and it did its job. It is light weight and does not add any bulk to the phone while protecting it. Well worth the money. I am thinking of ordering a few more of these in different colors. :-) My favorite TPU case. Offers enough protection and grip, can take off easily and slip it right back on. I can slip a couple of cards and bills between the phone and the case if need be. Adds too much bulk to my phone, hence I purchased a different case.  Also unlike the pictures on the site, the buttons on your phone will be covered.  The areas on the case where the power button and volume rocker are located are covered by plastic.  Not good in my opinion.  Makes it harder to press those buttons.  Might be preferred by those looking for a good amount of protection for their phone. This case is a little thicker than my old TPU slim case but I expected that and really like the firmness of the material used.  No gaps or flimsy rubber on this.  This is my everyday case now.  Fit and finish as great and feels good in the hand. Case is very nice, great, solid fit. The feel is very nice and minimal size. The buttons seem to be a bit hard to press for me, volume and on/off, but probably just need to get used to the feel. Nice case, good build, solid fit. Slides in to pocket without issue. This case has a tackle touch which makes it nice to carry. Not worried about dropping the phone.Fits well and works just fine,  thank you very much. . Fits well, offers decent protection and gives the phone good grip at a good price. I would order this case again. This thing is sweet. I have to say that so far this is the best case that I have tried out from Box Wave. It slipped on very snug and was even harder to get off. Although it is not impossible to get off it is difficult which is a good thing in my book. This case is very comfortable in the hand and just feels right. All controls were easily accessed and everything on my Galaxy Note 2 worked fine with the case on it. The only thing I didn\\'t like was that this does not come with a holster. I like to use holsters and carry my phone on my belt. Well I did manage to find a holster from one of my earlier purchases for my phone and it fit the Box Wave like a glove. It was from one of those 2 piece rubber and hard plastic cases that Amazon sells for about $7.00. I can\\'t remember the name but as soon as I do I will update this review so you can order this case and holster combo just for the holster. I have had the chance to locate the name of the case and holster and it is from \"Rhino\" brand. The ones I have were \"Black Rhino\". I hated the cases but the holster is a perfect fit for this Box Wave case. Bought to replace another that I bought for my wife a year ago and it is great. Not heavy, stand work the way it should and it fits like a glove. Gives grate stability to the slippery side of the phone and allows for one handed function. I have bought many cases for many different cellphones and this is the first case that compelled me to write a review.  This is by far, THE best case I have ever had.  It fits so perfectly, you\\'d think that it was meant to be a second skin for the phone.  and the fact that it doesn\\'t add a lot of bulk, but feels like it will protect very well makes it that much better.  This case is worth more than double or triple the price.  I wish they made this exact case for every phone.  It would be my go-to case.  Please make one for the HTC ONE! First, I\\'m a huge fan of TPU cases; and hate silicone ones.  There\\'s a huge difference, in case you, the reader, doesn\\'t know.  TPU is better... LIGHT YEARS better!But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there; and not because there\\'s anything wrong with the TPU. Rather, it\\'s because they\\'re cheaply made, or not cut precisely accurately... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut.  It\\'s perfect.  Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath... the camera lens, the flash, the speaker, the mic holes, the earphone jack, and, of course, the stylus.  Note that there\\'s no holes for the power button or volume rocker......and that, TRUST ME, is the way it SHOULD be!  So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers, and that\\'s a huge mistake.  If you\\'ve ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know, the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you\\'ve ever open one of those up and cleaned one, then you\\'ve seen the dark kinda\\' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot.  That stuff is body oil, mixed with skin cells, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with lint from the mouse pad, mixed with godknows what else.  It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch......including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone!  And when that stuff gets in there, buttons stick, and phones either won\\'t turn on or off, or can\\'t have their screens awakened properly... or, one of the common ones which people often don\\'t realize is caused by a sticking power button:  boot loops!Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem.  Of course, there\\'s still the electromechanical HOME key that\\'s uncovered; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken, because their HOME keys cause weird behavior; but, in fact, all that\\'s wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with... well... you get the picture.There\\'s not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem (if it\\'s a hardware electromechanical one, as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass), but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them......and this one does... and magnificently.  It even has nicely-molded buttons (as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it.  This case is simply molded beautifully!This case is special for another reason, too, which many people, I\\'ll bet, don\\'t know about, and that\\'s precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone: the bezel around the glass screen.  It\\'s really nice, and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda\\' unique in that the very, very edges of its glass screen  aren\\'t like almost any other phone.  Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens; and then there\\'s the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass\\'s edge all-\\'round; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen, so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table, the glass, itself, it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table\\'s surface.Well, the Note II\\'s glass is actually higher up (when it\\'s lying on its back) than the bezel edge of the case; and, in fact, the very, very edge of the Note II\\'s glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case\\'s bezel. As such, if you lay the Note II on its face (on its glass, it\\'s the glass that actually touches the table.  This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors; and one maker of them (REALOOK) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II: one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II\\'s screen, and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge; and then they make another (the REALOOK \"3D\" screen protector for the Note II) that\\'s molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II\\'s glass, and \"hang\" down over it, so to speak, to make the protector\\'s edge come closer to the case\\'s bezel, and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases, the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel, that\\'s fine.  The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass.  But with the  REALOOK \"3D\" style screen protector that wraps over the edge, that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass, so that if the phone is laid on its face (on its glass sreen), the glass doesn\\'t touch because it\\'s being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk.  But it gets better:  That edge \"respects\" the rounded edge of the Note II\\'s glass, and doesn\\'t try to wrap up over onto and cover it.  Therefore, the REALOOK 3D screen protector\\'s edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case... different from most others... and the only kind you can have, actually, if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to, or over the edge of, the Note II\\'s glass.Seriously, this thing is PRECISION... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II... and got it PERFECT!The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it wouldn\\'t show such fingerprints.  The TPU cases out there that are called \"s-style\" or \"s-series\" TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the \"s\" shape on the case\\'s back, and a shiny finish (like this case has everywhere) on the other side of the \"s\" shape on the case\\'s back.  The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that\\'s on those \"s\" cases, in my opinion; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly, those \"s\" series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass, and on the Note II, that doesn\\'t work well with most screen protectors. Plus, many of those \"s\" style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons. Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp; and so for me, at least, it\\'s worth it to just endure its shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.Great case!  Best-of-breed, at least among cases that don\\'t cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up.  If one is not using a \"3D\" type of screen protector from REALOOK, though; if one is using REALOOK\\'s other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II\\'s screen, then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine (as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons); but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one. Seriously, this one is made very, very well... very precise. I just love it!Gregg L. DesElmsNapa, California USAgregg at greggdeselms dot com i returned it because it came dented.  I like it , wish i could have used it.  They said i got the last one. Nice, looks with good & durable quality & price wise as well. Really works as described...for my samsung note 2. I do buy accessories online now...more way cheaper & find it no difference from what\\'s on the store which are very expensive. Does what it needs to do at an excellent price.  Fits well, seems rigid enough to prevent some damage, and the kickstand is a nice touch.  I don\\'t know how well the kickstand will hold up over time, but works well.  The ridge around the front allows me to put the phone face down without it touching a table.  The case is pretty compact and still fits into the Smart Dock, although it prevents HDMI from registering.  So it charges and goes into dock mode, but doesn\\'t seem to sit down far enough to engage the HDMI. Bought this for my daughter  for her phone and she loves it.  Solid case and easily cleaned with soap and water. A little thick but protects well and the kickstand is stronger than other cases I\\'ve tried.The thicker corners also make it harder to slide into my car dock. The Boxwave case I bought for my Note II (Bodysuit) has disappeared from Amazon. This is the same case but with a uniform glossy texture.  I had a Boxwave case for my Note I and it was great.  This new case is even better.  It is thinner and more streamlined, and the buttons work even better.  This doesn\\'t have cutouts for the buttons, instead it has well-designed buttons of its own molded into the case that push on the phone\\'s buttons.  I like this because the buttons work just as well but they are protected at the same time from crud/damage.  Cutouts for the ports/mics/camera/stylus are placed perfectly and sized appropriately. Lastly, this case is made from TPU, which is the best case material in my opinion.  It\\'s firmer so it stays on the phone better than the soft silicone cases and does not pick up lint or stick to your pocket, while still offering some cushion when you drop it. I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone. However it did interfere with my cellular signal and brought my bars down from 3 to 1 and sometimes none. I started dropping calls and the people on the other line said I was fading in and out when I was able to talk to someone. I took the cover off my Note 2 and my bars popped back up to 3 and I had no problems with phone calls anymore. I tried it again to make sure it was the cover, and sure enough it did the same thing as before. I had my partner try it as he has the same kind of phone and it did the same thing to his Note 2. So I had to return the case for a refund. It is disappointing because it was a great looking case. Fits perfect, nice clean look, I am going to buy another one to leave it inside my car just in case. I love the way this case looks and feels. But I wish the buttons were a little more tactile and the side hugged the phone a bit more. Otherwise I feel quite confident in the protection and the kickstand. This is a regular case, fit, I believe it\\'s not pretty at all but neither bulky and the protection it\\'s intermediate . This cover is very nice, it looks expensive. well built, and built to last. I recommend this cover.  Get it The cover fits properly leaving all the necessary openings available for easy access.  It keeps the screen lifted off the surface when the phone is put face down.  Overall, it does all what I need it to do.  Operating the power and volume buttons is a little awkward as it is hard to find the buttons by feel.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for basic protection. Not a very well made case, thought it would be of better quaility, hard to tell from just looking at it on the site. I\\'ve bought several hard cases for my note2 and this one is my favorite. It\\'s easy to put on and take off (once you figure it out). I don\\'t drop my phone usually so I can\\'t say how it will do if you drop it but it only covers the back and the sides. it\\'s a one piece hard case which I really like. I\\'m very pleased with this case. One piece that slips on fairly easily. It\\'s not real grippy like some but has enough grab that you can hold onto it. Goes in and out of my holder and pocket easy enough. The stand on the back works great! When the stand is closed it\\'s flush with the back of the case so it lays flat. Some cases, with stands, have hinges and parts that sick out. The blue is nice and true to on line image. I really like it. The price is amazing! Flawless fit, materials and looks. Mixing clear and frosted materials looks really cool. Adds almost nothing to the width, thickness and weight. Volume buttons a little hit and miss though if you\\'re not looking at the phone while trying to raise/lower the volume. Would have been really flawless if it had click-able volume and power buttons. Nice looking case.  Very inexpensive and seems to fit very well.  Excellent value and it feels good in hand.  A little softer than I like and therefore most likely prone to losing it\\'s shape/tightness over time. This is a good, inexpensive case. I use a case to make the phone less slippery so I won\\'t drop it, and this one does a decent job. I searched online for a case for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II, and decided on this product with it\\'s cool design. It has provided sufficient protection and I especially like the grip-ability on the sides. I always buy BoxWave cases for my phones, because they are well made, practical, comfortable and good looking. This time I am disappointed, the cuts for camera with flash, S-pen, speaker and microphones are too big and it looks ugly. Plus because the S-pen is in the corner of the phone and the cut for it really big, it doesn\\'t provide good protection at this corner. What if the phone falls on this corner? Great design and protected my phone really well from droppings. My one year old dropped it all the time and no problem. But the big problem is that it\\'s stained.
